0,4660558,2019-02-08,5,"It was my first meeting with Chad Tuesday. I would recommend him. Derrick helped me join. Both men have a great personality, no pressure. glad to be a new member. I have mentioned the club to many friends and coworkers. Several have expressed interest I, couldn't ask for more. I was a member at the JCC for 5 years and it didn't fit my needs. LA Fitness is better equipped, cleaner and the equipment is more than I had hoped for. Wish the pool was a bit warmer since I swim for physical therapy. A steam room would be fabulous. No complaints."
1,3733912,2018-06-11,4,LA fitness is competitive to the other big fitness franchises. I go to this one because it's the closest to where I live. I also like the fact that I could go to any of their facilities when they are maintaining the pool where they have aquafit exercises and jacuzzi - the reasons I go to this gym. They did offer me a reasonable price for the membership.
2,3733858,2018-06-05,5,"The equipment is kept in great working order and the locker room is clean and also in great condition. The staff is friendly and helpful too. The facilities are large and include racketball, full court basketball, swimming pool, steam room and whirlpool, two exercises rooms for classes and a special fitness training area to be used with a trainer."
3,3733861,2018-06-04,4,My gym meets my needs although at times it is a little crowded and the racket ballers sit on the machines instead of the benches provided. But like all gyms people that sit on a machine and read their e-mail are the most annoying thing but I don't see what can be done by any gym about that.
4,3733852,2018-05-30,4,"Lucky for me I know what I'm doing at the gym. The employees there are worse than useless, they are actively non-responsive. Cleanliness is okay on at certain hours, I'm sure they just don't have the staffing to do any better. I was grandfathered in from Vision Quest and only pay $16 a month. I would not go here if I had to pay full price."
5,5925754,2019-05-21,1,"Jimmy (the PT manager) is a scammer. He lured me away from my gym workout to do a “survey” for him. Then he pressures me into signing up for PT sessions. PT sessions that they don’t even have a trainers to fulfill. He says he will be your trainer, and then he sticks you with multiple new people with no experience that are there for a few days and then quit. Because of their “staffing issues”, there are no trainers. Complain, and Jimmy says “if you want another trainer you have to pay more per month”. I have to pay more because you don’t have any trainers on staff! Then he says, “You can wait until they hire someone else”. So I should just keep paying you this monthly fee for nothing until you hire someone to fulfill your end of the agreement! That is **. Call to cancel PT sessions. They tell me a VP from the company will call me. A week later and still no call. So I filed a complaint with the BBB. All LA Fitness is doing is high pressure sales scam. Their personal trainers aren’t even qualified or certified. No experience whatsoever."
6,5905066,2019-05-20,1,"I signed up 4 months ago, they attached my account and credit card to someone I don't know, and repeatedly charge my card against his account, even after I cancelled the membership. Their CS reps said they couldn't help, I had to wait until the manager came back in on Monday. The general manager said I'd receive a call on Monday by noon. When I called at noon, the manager Vaughn, said he would call back in 15 minutes. When I called him back 3+ hours later, his answer was he was busy with other customers in front of him. Total joke, no one accountable or able to help. Never even used a single piece of equipment but got charged 4 months straight (credited back after the fact, but simply ridiculous)."
7,5806591,2019-05-15,1,I took membership and continued for one week. I had to cancel because of relocation. I have followed long process to cancel the membership. but they are continuously charging me since last four month... Even after cancellation.... Maybe this still continues....
8,5730823,2019-05-12,1,On or about April 12th I received a phone call for a LA Fitness representative in regards to a past due bill for March and April 2019. It is at that time I requested for my membership to be cancelled and a final bill be mailed to the address on file. The representative informed me my final bill was $61.98. On April 14th I received an email in regards to the past due amount and it is at that time I requested for a final bill as well. As of today I have not received confirmation that my membership was cancelled. Also I see charges in the amount of $30.99 three times and $5.00 attempts daily on my card statement. I received a reply after two months indicating membership cancellation is only in person to verify it’s actually you. My issue with that is how can you verify it’s me when you call to request payment over the phone? When you send an email to the address on file and I reply with the card or membership number why isn’t that sufficient to cancel my membership? I literally called my back to block them from charging my card on file. I’m only paying for the two months because that was explained over the phone or email back in April when I requested the membership cancellation.
9,5647834,2019-05-08,1,"I wish I had read all the reviews here before signed up for the gym. They're truly selfish and care for the money more than anything. Once you signed up for them, they never care about your problems. Before then they were trying to reach out to me to try their training sessions until I decided to sign up. Even though I told them I could not do a contract, I'd be moving out in like in 5 months, they said not a problem; they can take of it. The contract help me get better deal, that's all they want to help me. How's nice right? Then, it's time, I'm moving out and trying to cancel the membership and trainings. I told them like 2 months in advance, so everything can be done smoothly. And, at least 3 times that they told me they’ll call me back the same day about my issues, but never; even though I went to see them in person couple times too. I ended up going to a different gym for helps. Until now, I do not even know if everything are solved for sure. I seriously do not want to talk to them for this problem anymore, especially if I'm not in the US. I seriously feel desperate. Sometime I want to report this to the police, not to sue them, just to protect my right that I have tried my best, but they did not do their job. I wish I never deal with them in my life. Life is busy enough for moving out of the country, to cancel Xcel Energy and internet service are way easier. TRUST ME! Join the gym that's not so much about business, like YMCA, a university gym. Even though it could be more expensive, you’ll for sure not have to deal with people trying to sell personal training, charging you for the annual fee (out of nowhere), and dealing with cancellation that's totally nonsense."
10,5612527,2019-05-06,1,This people are selfish people that only care about making money and do not care of actually helping their members. I am now have to deal with their headache and trying to purchase a home. Never again.
11,5503597,2019-05-01,3,I was looking for a place to play indoor basketball in Florida so I tried the L.A. Fitness by my work. I went with the cheapest option to use the facility and play ball. The initiation fee was $75. Then it was about $37/mo with the 'annual fee' of $52. WAY too much money to play basketball!
12,5465719,2019-04-30,1,The WORST customer service I have EVER seen in my life. They sign you up and then they neglect you. Once you sign up they don’t care about you anymore. I talked to literally everyone for some help with my personal training. They charged me almost 200 dollars a month for personal training excluding membership fees and they don’t have trainers available. What’s funny is right before you sign LA FITNESS personal training manager makes you feel everyone is there for but in reality no one is because they already got you. STAY AWAY FROM LA FITNESS.
13,5435524,2019-04-28,1,"This gym like most has its supply of immature bullies that think they're Hercules Unchained. Unfortunately, on two occasions I've experienced this incivility. Being a senior, I won't tolerate this nonsense. Btw, there's no presence of any representatives around anywhere, and therefore, no supervision of these ""gen pop"" folks. One incident occurred today and so I searched for a manager to inform of the situation. When I reported it to Tyler the ""director of personal training"" he began laughing and said it's my problem to deal with. I had him cancel my membership on the spot. If you don't mind an unsupervised prison yard, then this is the place for you."
14,5284843,2019-04-19,1,"I want to give LA fitness no star, but unfortunately, there is no option for that. Yesterday, I went to LA Fitness in Long Island and trying to cancel my gym membership. The front desk guy told me I have to come back tomorrow because they only make the cancellation from 9 AM to 5 PM. I ask: ""What do you have to do to cancel the membership?"" The guy said, “I have to click the cancel button, but I can't do that right now because of the policy. Or you can print out the form and mail it to the company.” Of course, I am not going to spend extra money to mail a form just to cancel my gym Membership. Today, I went back to the gym at 0935. The staff told me the only person can do the cancellation is the operation manager, but he haven't come to work yet. I wait there until 1020. I ask the staff if they can call him. The staff was not willing to do that. The staff told me to write down my number. When the manager gets to work; they will call me. (They never call). Somehow my heart tells me I should go to a different gym. So I went to a different LA FITNESS. I am happy that I was able to get my gym membership canceled. The operation manager service in this LA fitness not any better. She gave me an bad attitude. I'm not even going through the detail. That just going to make me angry. This is the first time I wrote a review. I don't want other people have to go through the same thing that I did. Also I do not recommend the personal trainer with them. I'm sure you can find a better one and with better price too."
15,5255890,2019-04-18,1,"Caution! Think about seeing your kids with broken arms or bloody face one fine day with thousands of dollars medical expenses and painful nights - This is where Kids Club at LA Fitness welcomes you even when you are paying higher monthly membership with respect to other Gyms. My 5 years old daughter got injured very badly. When I asked for CCTV footage, manager informed that they did not put camera there due to legal constraints as that would require more parameters to implement before they get the eligibility. This is just to cover up their lack of supervision, high level of carelessness, negligence to safety and least responsibility."
16,5255479,2019-04-17,1,"Each time I have been to the sauna at the Lynnwood LA Fitness, there are women talking in very loud voices to each other across other people - very inconsiderate. I have asked management to address this situation and it seems they have had other complaints about it. They do nothing - a simple notice to please keep your voices to a respectful level posted on the door would be so easy. But they refuse to - instead they ask the other guests to control the situation. They are so lackadaisical about member concerns once they get your monthly dues - it seems that is all they care about. They have been through manager after manager at this location, and it seems they forget to train them in Customer Service - they seem to disregard the fact that they are there for US. Sad way to run a business."
17,5191648,2019-04-15,1,"I had moved to a different city, so I wanted to cancel my membership with LA Fitness. I went to their office area, and was told I need to only cancel with the their office manager, who only worked at 9-5pm which were inconvenient for people who work those hours. The saleswoman told me however that I was able to cancel my membership with a form that that was convenient as I would moved to a different city as it would take me an hour to go to the gym to cancel in purpose. I send in the mail. This was much easier for me. So I had submitted the form to the main office in LA, California. I did not think of anything afterwards. For the following months I was still charged for my membership, even though I had submitted the paperwork to a T. I then called my bank to halt the charges as they were incorrect charges. Again I didn't think of it any further. I then was called multiple times by LA Fitness collections that I need to pay my monthly dues. I have told them my prior cancelation process. They then told me that they did not have the authority to cancel my membership. I told them to then take it on their end to someone within LA Fitness to cancel my membership. They told me they were unable to do so.My last resort was to call their main office number to cancel my membership. At that point I was able do. However my membership would have a negative balance. The customer service representative would told me that it would not go to collections and if I chose to start a new membership, it would be a different account. I have worked with other gyms such as 24 Fitness and Planet Fitness. With those gyms, I could talk to anyone who was at the front desk to cancel my membership. Not so with LA Fitness. This has been the only gym that has been the most challenging to cancel a membership. The experience has been frustrating, annoying, and a waste of time. LA Fitness specifically has this system to maintain a revenue for them. I suggest to never use this service unless it was the only gym in your area, and you know you will moving at any means for work, pleasure, or family."
18,5175970,2019-04-15,1,"I was told 1 thing at the Doral FL location and another over the phone w/ customer service. I wanted to add 2 members and a guest to my husband's acct. I was told I could not do this. Lie NO 1. I had to open a new membership. I had an online offer for $0 down for family add ons and was told they would honor at the loc. Lie No 2. Long story short I was told and it was handwritten on a piece of paper that I would be paying 74.98 a month. Lie No 3. I was charged $122.00 and then another $37.99 the same month. I have tried several times to speak to someone at the Doral but either they do not speak well English to understand and I even heard a chuckle from the man with the broken English as well, which supposedly was the accounts manager. I called customer service. They said I have to go the the Doral location and back and forth. It's so unprofessional frustrating. I still do not have a clear answer to the billing issue. If all would have gone well I could have put 2 new members add ons to my husband's account and call it a day. I feel ripped off and have wasted so much time on this issue."
19,5003107,2019-04-04,1,"Three months ago I signed up. I’ve been here several times before and I was a pleased with the services about 2 -3 years ago. Today it’s a-shame at how they do people. I thought I can trust them to take out the $29.99 dollars every month only. Well today not only did they snatch $29.99 from me; but also $49.99 the next second. Right beside my bank statement says an annual fee. I called these money hungry vampire scumbags and this lady tells me. Well we charge an annual fee after three months. I told her it’s not even a whole year yet. And flew down there to cancel immediately. Then I respectfully asked if they offer refunds for my $49.99 since it was not a whole year to even take out “annually” because like I said. IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE MONTHS since I’ve joined. She reacted they way I was hoping she would not. She came off very negative, defensive, as well as being sarcastic (The whole time I’m talking to my aunt in the phone about this horrible experience). I told her look I don’t feel like hearing all that I just want to cancel and get out of here. She says your cancellation done. Then I asked her can I have a print out. She does it and sarcastically says have a good day, which this company ruined my entire day. Left me with less money in my bank and then finds a way to get nasty because you are leaving them. My advice buy your own gym equipment and set it up in the privacy of your own home. I will never let another greedy money making gym pimp take out my account as long as I live."
20,4964866,2019-04-02,1,"It feel like that they are determined to get money from you by pulling any tricks possible. First they said no annual fee, good price and access to any LA fitness. After we sign up they send us change notice and we have to pay higher monthly fee than what we agreed to and they lost our original paperwork we signed. Next they said it does not include any LA fitness just local one. Yesterday we got update that we have to pay annual fee. I waiting what will be next. But we are in process to change to different place. So be careful. They are there to get you."
21,4963912,2019-04-02,3,"Member of this LA Fitness location for 5 months. Staff does not interact or police gym at all. Main complaint-broken equipment and jerks who have video conferences, no headsets, yelling at each other - can you believe it! I ask about cell phone policies and they have no idea what I'm talking about. If someone walked around and kicked the jerks off equipment who are just sitting and talking on phones, we could actually get a routine done."
22,4957906,2019-04-01,1,I signed up on Dec 29th and paid 198 and I was told 24.99 a month was what I would pay. Now on April 1st a mysterious annual bill pops up on my Reddit card for 49.99 for one thing in 4 months is NOT annual and where did this come from. I was never told of any other bill. For the other part of this review their hours are terrible. If any other gym shows up close enough to use I will leave and never look back. RIP OFF ALERT! ON THE ONLY GOOD NOTE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT ARE NICE BUT AS A COMPANY THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF.
23,4952383,2019-03-30,1,"I was planning on joining the club in Randolph since my family relocated recently from South Jersey, NJ. Upon arriving I was told that the class I was interested in was cancelled, but Kevin took my information anyway and I was told to download the 4 days pass and come back. I asked Kevin if I can take a walk around the gym and he did allow it, but never suggested he will take me around to show the facility or tell me more about the club/answer any questions. While walking around by myself I saw the class actually wasn't cancelled and I did try it out. Today, I came to the gym to try a yoga class and was told by Kevin that he cannot use my downloaded 4 day pass because I already used my one day pass. I was never warned that I will not be able to use the 4 days pass and that on the day I had my first visit I'm using a 1 day pass. Kevin and the other manager just laughed at me basically and said they've been there for many years and it is always like that. They never even apologized for not explaining it to me on the first visit or for any inconvenience, when I asked for the phone # to call I was provided with the # that is no longer in service. My husband has been a member of LA Fitness for 17 years now in South Jersey, and it is very disappointing to have an experience like this at the new place which we were considering to join. If this is the customer service for the potential members what can we expect when we join?"
24,4925263,2019-03-28,1,"I am a current member, soon to be a former member of LA Fitness. I have been a member for almost 4 years and they have low level customer service. At their Alexandria Virginia location on Heneska Lane, their Director of training, Justin is the reason I will be ceasing my membership. He was very manipulative with trying to get me to sign up with a trainer. He was personable and friendly, but once he knew I had to “think on it” he became so rude, dismissive, disrespectful and mean. He told me “ we don’t need you to sign up, we have 1,500 members at this location” and also said “if you sign up it’s no benefit to me and it’s something for you, we don’t need you to sign up”. In an attempt to sale the training sign up, Justin devalued the group classes such as Pilates and yoga and deemed them “old lady classes” which was a shock to me and I responded with “that's not nice, those are paying customers”. It was such a turn off and I immediately asked for a manager. They informed me a manager was not on site and would not give me a last name of the manager. This location is very unprofessional and sadly I spend money here only to be mistreated and uncared for."
25,4863931,2019-03-22,1,"Worse gym ever. The employees are rude. For all the times I tried to go swim, the pool is either dirty, crowded, someone is adding cleaners or noisy maintenance. For few times, at around 6:00 am,while I am entering, an employee would stop me to ask to take a photo. A person called many times to schedule a personal training. I said I am busy. He insisted. I agreed just to escape this continuous calling. At the day of the appointment (it took me a lot of efforts to fit his time to my schedule) he called and canceled claiming he has a conference call!! Seriously? I said fine. He started calling back again. He didn't stop until I went and found him in person and said, ""I will find you when I need a personal eval, please stop calling me."" I went few times in the early morning and the pool was so crowded, so I returned home without exercising. Today, I went to cancel my membership and the woman was extremely RUDE. She lied about my obligations claiming that I need to pay half the rest of the contract year fees, or stay as a member until the end of that year. I told her that I am not aware of such rules and that I was informed about $50.00 cancellation fees only. Hum, she changed her words. I asked her to subtract the leftover fees of March from the cancellation fees, since I will not use the gym EVER AGAIN. She refused. Now I am paying LA fitness money for a service that I do not want or use. Fraud!!! The location is Westworth, Tarrant County, TX."
26,4820347,2019-03-13,1,"I have recently joined the LA Club in Houston. At the time I joined, I paid for the multi club access and when I showed up they said my membership was for single club access; However, after several phone calls, the club corrected the problem and I could go to any location if needed. Three months later I got hit for a yearly membership charge (which I wasn't made aware off during the signing up) and when I call the local club manager and was told that it is written in the contract and it's up to me to read, they are not obligated to advise you at the point of signing up contract. So I went ahead and cancel the membership even I just paid the full year membership. Lastly, they do not make the cancellation process that easy, you must go to the club to do it or create an online account before you can download the cancellation form. Overall, I wish that I can give them 1/2 star because that is what LA Fitness Club is worth. I should have read the reviews before joining this club."
27,4815382,2019-03-12,1,Machines always broken and not repaired for months. I informed staff and he just blew me off that they are fine even though the ellipticals don't incline and click loudly. Always packed at 9am 10am. People in Corona don't work!!! Come here if you want broken machines and packed with people all the time.
28,4732591,2019-02-22,1,"Little Rock, AR - LA Fitness on University Ave. has no women’s basketballs and have approximately 6 men’s available. I asked them for a women’s and they stated it’s not even on the LA Fitness equipment order form! How is this even possible?!? I’ve contacted corporate and the guy who answered stated no one has even brought this up? I informed him I will continue to call until this is changed."
29,4704610,2019-02-18,2,"This isn't a complaint about the facility, which is well equipped. However, it's a real pain as far as dealing with the sales staff! When I went in to sign up, I was given a couple of options, both with hefty ""registration"" and ""service"" fees and I was told I had to sign up for a year. I mentioned that it was quite possible that I wouldn't be in the area for a year, and I was assured that that was no problem -- I could sign up for the year and then if I moved, I could bring in a letter with my new address (to prove I had moved) and they would cancel the membership. That didn't sound all that good to me, so I said I would have to go home and think about it. When I got home, I got another sales call to get me to sign up. I said I would think about it. Then I got an email, once again detailing the ""great deal"" I could get if I signed up now. I noticed -- in small letters -- that there was a link that said something like ""view other membership options"" so I clicked on the link. Lo and behold, there was a four month membership listed and if I paid the four months up front, there were no additional ""registration"" or ""service"" fees!So I went back in and told another sales rep I was ready to sign up. At first, he acted as if he didn't know anything about a four-month plan. But I told him it was on the information that was sent to me and that was the plan I wanted; he managed to find it and I signed up. Then I was told I would have one free personal training session as part of the deal, which I assumed would include an assessment, an intro to the machines so I could be sure I was using them properly and a bit of a workout. Not exactly. There was a brief assessment that lasted about 15 min.I was shown one exercise that would help address one of my weaker areas. Then I was told we needed to go back to the desk to finish the assessment. There I did a quick biometric test and the rest of the hour was spent trying to get me to buy into a personal training contract that ALSO included $199 in sign up charges and then $60 to $70 per session in addition...which also had to be on a 12 month contract. When I said I might not be in the area for that long, I was told it would be possible to get a six month contract, or I could pay for a block of training sessions, but then I would have to pay more money.When I said I thought it was too expensive, it was suggested I could work with one of the less senior trainers which would save me $5 a session. Then I was told that if I signed up right away, he had this one coupon left where he could get me $50 off of the registration, bringing it down to only $149 instead of $199... Although I might have been interested in a less intense option for the span of time I planned to use the facility, it was clear to me that I was being pressured into fitting into a contract to suit the company, not me, and that the extra fees were total BS. So I declined. I never did get any intro to the machines..."
30,4702246,2019-02-17,1,"I joined the LA Fitness club in Clark, NJ when it opened in the summer of 2015. At that time they had a Grand Opening special of $0 initiation fee and $29.99 a month for multi club access throughout the state, $19.99 for single club access. First and last months payment up front. I signed for the full access, $29.99. I gone for over 3 1/2 years to other LA Fitness clubs all over NJ, then the beginning of 2019, they become a “Signature Club”. I found that out when my credit card was charged for visiting the LA Fitness in Union, I inquired why I was charged and was told because I only have single club access. I said, since when? I always had multi since this club opened. I have a copy of my original contract, the way it was put in on the computer says “single access” and there was no mention of the grand opening promotion, they only said that because you didn’t pay an initiation fee, you can only use this club. Well excuse me, nowhere on my paperwork does it say that and that’s not what was explained to me when I joined. I called the manager, no help. I called corporate, no help. I asked why wasn’t I charged the last 3 years at the other locations if I only had single access? No one could answer me. They’re scammers. Bait and switch. They’ll say and do anything to get a sale. My credit card was charged without authorization or my knowledge. Never got my money back. They need to be stopped. This has to be illegal."
31,4697968,2019-02-16,1,"Today is my second day at the LA Fitness Club and I will not go back!!!! I will call LA Fitness and cancel my membership, hopefully there won't any problems with my cancelation, hopefully it won't take 2 months, hopefully there are no hidden costs... What prompt my cancelation???? I have bad feeling about this ""new Club"" and I never go wrong about my intuition or perhaps my educated guess. I wish I would have noticed certain aspects of the Club which I do not like before signing the membership. It seems to me that they operate under the same Old game... ""I will say and do everything to get you to signed..."" For me is important the way the service is executed, politeness, friendliness, positive attitude and good manners are vital. After all a fitness club should be a place where we all can feel relax and enjoy the benefits of our hard earned money!! Btw there is large amount of retirees using the facilities at this Club and I do not think they are treated kindly. I do not want to be in a place where the elderly are treated poorly, retirees deserve to be treated with the utmost respect. A smile will create wonders. Lucky for me there are many studios in Town run by high calibre people whose sole desire is to make you feel welcome, relax, such attitude is the reflection of their honesty and good will. Nothing can replace those elements."
32,4667020,2019-02-10,1,DO NOT SIGN UP FOR PERSONAL TRAINING FROM LA FITNESS. LA Fitness facilities are OK but their Personal Training is a major ripoff. They charge major bucks for training and then pay the trainers next to nothing. As a result trainers leave with high regularity. In 6 months we had 4 different trainers with large gaps in between while LA Fitness searched for replacements. We ended up receiving only half of the promised training and LA fitness refused to issue any refund.
33,4665001,2019-02-10,1,"Looking to give a zero on my review. The LA Fitness pool area has the same clumps of hair and the same trash floating about week after week now, previously entering the facility I would see it dirty, report it to the front desk area. They need major cleaning done, the floors are very dirty with hair, used band-aid and sport tapes, inside the pool there is sand and white objects floating around. Complained to the front desk but they never sent anyone to clean it. Corporate office need to meet the standards of healthy and safety."

Unfortunately, I had to cancel my membership due to moving far away from any LA Fitness locations, and they promptly helped cancel."
35,4603312,2019-01-26,1,"Very Dirty and Apathetic Staff. My wife got me a subscription for my birthday. She specifically was concerned with cleanliness. The dude assured that they had high scores. That's hard to believe because the place is filthy. Every day. On one day the men's locker room had torn wet tissue paper all over the floor. I mentioned it the girl at the front desk and her response was ""The cleaning guy doesn't come in until 2:00."" I think it was around noon at the time. Great answer, Syndey. The next time we went my wife saw gum in the cup holder of one of the treadmills. Three days later she went to the same treadmill that had the same gum in it. The more we were there the more we realized how gross this place was. The second month's charge happened earlier than it was suppose to, or explained to us. A payment department called and my wife explained that we weren't happy with our membership and that it wasn't what was sold to us; a clean gym. My wife spoke to two different people over the phone who said they would make sure the account was cancelled and that the message of the dirty gym would be emailed to the managers. Guess what, we get charged again. I go in this time and specifically ask to speak with a sales manager. She argues with me, and I end up having to ask her repeatedly to get a manager. She continues to try to make excuses, this girl clearly does not want me to talk to a manager. I tell her the situation about the over-the-phone cancellation, which she claims they don't do any cancellations over the phone. So either she is lying or the people over the phone are.Eventually one of the sales people comes up and basically just stands there and mean mugs. She says she paged a manager, but after a few minutes she's trying to hand me someone's card and get me out the door. I decide to take a walk around the place and take some pictures. On my way out I mentioned to Mr. Meanmug that all of the trashcans in the men's locker room are full and that it's dirty. His response, ""Great."" Lastly, the machines are not in a great shape either. Multiple are out of order. Don't do business with these people."

37,4602721,2019-01-26,3,"So I've been looking into getting myself into better shape and needed someone to hold me accountable. I happened to ""win"" one personal training session at LA Fitness and liked the people I worked with. In a moment of weakness maybe, or perhaps I should have asked to read the contract more, I signed up the same day. However, I've learned not to be too naive either, so I decided to look into what other people were saying about the program and what their results were. To my surprise, I saw a lot more negative in regards to how the gym itself handled its business and sometimes how the people at LA treated their customers as well. Feeling uncomfortable being bound in a contract to a gym that does not handle their business well, I immediately looked over the contract and found out I had until midnight on the third business day from when I signed the contract to cancel. Immediately I gathered up all of my evidence and, not only sent a contract to the PO Box in CA, but I also went to the gym I originally signed up at.Let me give you the good in my experience: I told the gym manager how I felt, totally honest, that I did not feel comfortable being bound by a contract with a company that does not seem to be too fair. I told her it was NOTHING against her, or the trainer, or even the specific gym I signed up at, but rather it was LA themselves and how they decided to handle business. The manager WAS TOTALLY understanding about it! She gave me no issue at all, didn't hassle me into sticking to it, nothing like that. The trainer when he did sign me up was also pretty transparent in how if I decided to cancel before the 12 months was up, I would be charged half of what I already owed. He also didn't try to BS me with ""It's free for the first 30 days."" So to that, I had no surprises. Also, fast forward to the end of this saga, another good experience I had was that I immediately got notice that I canceled my services with them via email and just this morning I got the notice that I will be refunded the $300 I put down to start up.The bad: While I was talking to the manager about all of this, the trainer that happened to sign me up walked by. The manager pulled him in and gave him the breakdown of what was going on. While the manager was in the room with us, the trainer seemed to be totally understanding and cool about the whole situation. However, as soon as the manager left, he started giving me crap about how ""he misjudged my character"" and that ""it was his fault that he misjudged me."" In short, this guy started portraying me as a bad person because I changed my mind and didn't feel comfortable with it. He felt the need to go on about how successful he is and how great the program works and ""it's just a bummer when someone does this because it looks bad on the program."" It was in that instance that I knew I made the right choice - this guy didn't care about me, he just cared about how many people he could sign up in his program. I even insisted that if he made money on the $300 I paid upfront, that he could just keep it, but I did not want to go forward with the training sessions. Even still he gave me the same crap and tried to guilt trip me into thinking I was the one at fault.So the plus side, this experience I had was good in that they honored my request to cancel the services. They didn't double charge me (so far that I've seen), nor did they lack in giving me documentation when I canceled. They also were pretty good in being open about the cost had I decided to cancel later in the sessions. However, the way I was treated after I was totally honest with them, and couldn't stress enough that it was nothing against the trainer himself, I am one of the many that is disappointed with this gym. There is absolutely no need to be so rude and condescending when someone does not feel comfortable with something."

I have a hearing impairment. She responded by encouraging the entire class to join in the screeching and told me I don't have to attend this class and can leave. I was humiliated, ridiculed and embarrassed in front of the entire class by **. I like this gym but this instructor needs to be taught that all members should be treated with respect."

The new manager took over in March but didn't inform me detailedly about how the PT payment actually works. I upgraded to $200 a month from $160 a month in Sep. 2018, from 4 sessions to 5 sessions. They told me it was gonna charge me only for 4 months and the manager will downgrade it for me back to $160, but they didn't, instead, they charged me for another month for Jan. 2019 without informing me and didn't want to give me back my money after I called the manager. The manager told me the operation manager couldn't file my request because the payment was ACTIVATED automatically and another month has started already. It's a SCAM I'd say. Total disappointment."

41,4569937,2019-01-18,1,"I would not suggest anyone to take the membership of LA fitness, although gym is good but the management is very bad. I have paid $275 from my wellness card for 5 months to LA fitness in advance for individual membership with one guest plus kids club. They kept on charging me more compared to what the agreement was with me. And the representative through whom I enrolled for the gym was of no help and he clearly told me that he can't do anything for payment gym is charging and asked me to call their corporate office to solve the problem. They waste your important time to call them and even after explaining all the calculations for the membership charges they still follow what's there in the system. I cancelled my membership and joined JCC gym which definitely has a nice management staff. I have heard from my friend that even if you cancel your membership, they keep on charging you from the credit card which is on their file with them."
42,4561450,2019-01-17,1,"Updated on 01/24/2019: I just canceled my LA Fitness membership due to one of their trainer’s unethical and unprofessional behavior. I paid for one-month personal training in cash, but the trainer did not come to the scheduled session, took two weeks for the refund after numerous texts, did not get a receipt, and he did not even apologize for the inconvenience. He took advantage of me, my money, and my time. While going through the cancellation process I was waiting for the membership refund (6 days and counting) when another charge was added to my credit card for the monthly payment. I never completed any cancellation form nor got a receipt. My advice for future fitness customers is to make use of their money better by using different gym, not LA Fitness. I feel LA Fitness took advantage of me, my money, and I will not bring my business there. Original Review: LA Fitness on Hamilton Rd, Westerville OH is associated with trainer that doesn’t appear for their session, say will return the payment for 4 sessions in advance, and don’t answer texts when called upon. The club should be partly responsible by association and by employing unethical employee... Sad, disappointed, will cancel membership, not worth my time and money."

44,4560832,2019-01-16,1,"I signed up for the month to month membership at LA Fitness on Cobb Parkway in Atlanta, GA back in summer. On my last day of using gym, I asked the front desk person to cancel my account and of course they said, “Sure we will take care of it.” Three months later, I noticed that they were still charging me for the monthly fee while I was not using the gym at all. When I called, I had to call multiple times and talk to different managers. Daniel (Assistant Manager) was very nice and understanding and he said that he will see what he can do and he will refund us for the months that we did not use the gym. On the other hand Phillip (Operational Manager) contact me saying that he is not going to refund me anything. He was so unprofessional, rude and surely had no experience on talking to customers on the phone. When I asked him that I would like to talk to the upper manager he ignored me and did not provide me with further information. It is so disappointing to see how LA fitness representative is so disrespecting to customers and how irresponsible they are for taking care of their customers. Obviously this is the lack of training for the person who cancelled my membership but they collected extra $90 from me while they knew I did not use the gym."

I have been mistreated every time I have asked for a timeline when will be fix. 8 month have been by and nothing. The jacuzzi service is offer when you sign up for the gym but is a lie when it doesn’t work. All I am asking is for it to get fix and I think 8 month is more than long in enough to get it fix."

I couldn't go in during the weekdays, as I work during those hours, so I went in on a Saturday. I was then told I needed to come in on a weekday as that is the only time an Operations Manager is there to cancel my membership. This is ridiculous and since I'm gone for the upcoming two weeks, I'm going to get billed yet again. Don't go to this specific location or LA fitness, in general."

They STILL charged the card I removed 280$ ON CHRISTMAS DAY! I’m so upset, I don’t expect to get my money back from them but I’m going to try my hardest.

Today I went to a Yoga class and I check the schedule before I went, when I got there, the class was canceled and when I ask to talk to the manager, there was no manager and when I explain the problem to one of the supervisors, the answer was: ""I don't make that schedule, it is not my fault."" All I was telling him was that they should cancel the classes at least 1 day before or several hours before the class, so people don't have to travel to the gym for nothing. In the last 2 month in 9 classes the instructors didn't show up (this is in 2 clubs, one in Pembroke Pines 184 st 6 classes and one in Sawgrass 3 classes.)"
52,4453111,2018-12-21,1,"If I could give this business zero stars I would. I don't think it even deserves one. This gym is an absolute scam. I am a young girl and my dad offered to sign me up for a gym membership. The membership was not very expensive, the gym appeared to be large and clean, and I was very excited to join. However, I do not know what the best workouts for my goals are and so when I got a call from LA Fitness saying that because I signed up for a membership, I would receive a free consultation for the training program. I took the offer just to see what it was all about. At the consultation, the head trainer, Leslie, explained to me the pricing and told me that with her help, I could achieve my goals within 6 months. I told her I would have to talk to my dad and get back to her. A few days later, my dad and I went in to talk about the training membership and go over pricing. My father and I decided it was too expensive and we could not afford it, and DID NOT sign the contract. A few days later my father received a charge for over $300. Confused, he called and they said they would refund the charge but did not. He ended up having to dispute the charge. He was then charged again for the same thing the next month.Annoyed, I went in to cancel my membership completely in hopes that these charges would stop. I spoke to the manager who canceled my membership but told me I had a training contract. I explained the situation of how we looked into it but it was too expensive and that we chose to not sign the contract. He looked up the contract and was very confused to see a signature under my name. I told them I was positive neither my father or I had signed anything, and they proceeded to make me write down my name and signature on a piece of paper to compare it to the contract. As you may have guessed, it was not a match, someone else had signed my name. The manager canceled my membership but told me that I may receive a couple more charges, some random phone calls, and emails, but eventually they would go away. That was months ago, but I was naive and took that as an answer.Fast forward to today, I was still receiving these charges, months after I had canceled my membership. I went in to talk to the manager and was ultimately told they couldn't do anything about it but the VP of LA Fitness ""loves to get involved"" and that he would call me before the business day ended. The business day has ended and I have received no call.My father is a very busy single-parent supporting three kids, and he has absolutely no time to deal with this which means I am attempting to fix this alone. I am very disappointed in the way LA fitness has handled this situation, and I believes it shows that they do not value their customers what-so-ever. I wish I had read of these poor reviews before I attended this gym, but please warn those who may sign up in the future. Thanks."

I called corporate and was told to go to another location which the closest is an hour during the times I go. So do not use their personal trainers. The salesperson lied about everything. And if you stop payment they will forward your contract to your bank or visa and they will take the money out without your permission.
54,4422613,2018-12-13,1,"I have been a member of this club since it was Holiday Spa back in the late '70s. I have always paid my dues on time, and over the past several years, I’ve paid online. I was surprised when I went to my LA fitness club in August of 2013, and was told that my membership was about to expire. I explained to them that I paid online and after bringing them proof from my bank, I was told that the payment had gone to Bally’s, and should have never been taken by them since the club was now owned by LA fitness. I was then told that to keep my membership current, I had to pay LA fitness and then get my refund for the original payment from Bally’s. So I paid my yearly membership fee a 2nd time, and have since been trying to get a refund from Bally’s. I’ve not gotten any help from LA fitness or Bally’s, and my only recourse was to go public with my situation on websites like “Yelp.” Neither LA fitness or Bally's have made any attempt to rectify this after three different attempts to get a response.Every time I walk into my local LA fitness club, I feel anger over the fact that I was forced to pay twice for one year’s membership. At the very least, it would be good public relations if LA fitness would simply credit me for the year I paid. I understand that my value as an LA fitness member is worthless compared to current memberships (because I've been a member so long, my yearly rates are a fraction of what current members pay), but in the interest of what’s fair, a credit to my membership would certainly be regarded as good customer relations."

Next day I observed that they have charged 3 times more than what was agreed upon and I see that my initials were copied using editor and all figures are changed. I made repeated complaints at the desk and they seem to stating it will be done in next couple of days and I see that they have again charged for the next month (Dec-18) for $55 while my plan is $21.99.

I saw him in gym many times and he avoided my wife and me. All we wanted was what he promised us. The guy was let go and I received a call from new store manager promising the world. Please come in so she can fix these issues. I explained I would not be coming back, felt I was taken advantage by LA Fitness and its signing up process. Very shady for a huge corporation. Do not sign agreements with this company!!! They continued to charge my credit card for the past 3 months for over $4000.00 dollars. Ruthless. I had to stop all charges with American Express.

These idiots still automatically charged my account the following month when I already canceled my membership... I had to go to the bank and get a whole new account with my bank so I don't keep getting charged for a membership that I canceled the previous month. I canceled my membership because of many reasons. Number one is that I would be there in the morning like 5 am and almost half the time the gym wouldn't be open because the staff is too lazy and unreliable to get up to open the gym. Second reason is because they had no hot water for a couple weeks and it was cold outside... I'm not going to take a cold shower when it's cold outside, I don't want to get sick. Finally they had someone mess with my account again, but this time my wife signed me up under her name and I went in one morning and they told me that my membership expired and wanted to renew my canceled membership... to make more money off me, so I had to have my wife go and take care of it when she got off work. It made everything a big hassle because of some greedy scam artist at LA fitness.Absolute losers who take advantage of people. I hope a better gym opens up and I'm not talking about Planet Fitness because that place is a joke too. I lift heavy sometimes and I don't scream or grunt, but I guess my muscle size can be intimidating especially when I have a good pump going on.

I sent a letter to them to stop charging. They call me today said, we have to pay until the agreement expires. Otherwise, I have to pay a penalty of over $800 to cancel the program.I requested to send me an agreement with my signature but NOT replying about my request. We have no invoice, agreement or any kind of receipt about the payment but somehow they are charging from my credit card account. Almost total money of $5000.00 which is we cannot afford.

That is, until he signs you up for the personal training program. With a significant weight loss goal, I was excited to work with someone who was seemingly knowledgeable, professional, and truly invested in helping me reach my goals. However, shortly after my first session - when things did not go his way - I was treated with the silent treatment and in a despicable and unprofessional manner. After leaving the gym in tears, I spoke with someone at the Corporate Service Office, who understood that it not acceptable to treat customers poorly and that the sales manager is NOT “in control” of scheduling and who you get to train with. Most importantly, she was able to connect me with another trainer who could help meet my training needs! For anyone who is dealing with a person in leadership with a big ego, find someone who is willing to listen and help you continue on your path to good health - TALK WITH CORPORATE and CALL OUT UNPROFESSIONAL AND INTIMIDATING, RUDE BEHAVIOR!

I asked them to put an 'Out of service' outside the sauna, although they keeping saying they will fix the issue, it's taking way too long for all of us who pays for a gym membership.

Another issue there are lots of people who goes in the sauna with food, put on smelly lotions when you are in a confined space and it is hot, the smell is very unbearable and not sanitary at all, they should put a sign outside 'no food allow and no scented items allowed'.

I went to another LA Fitness who told me that I could write a letter to corporate to cancel. Yep a freaking letter! NOT an email. Why? Because they can squeeze at least an extra month out of you in gym dues this way. This franchise is an overpriced, trainer reject SCAM!"
66,4289542,2018-11-13,1,"Billed for personal training sessions for which the trainer called and canceled and yet I was billed. Despite repeated promises that the payment would be reversed, it never has been. To add insult to injury they cut a lock off my locker a few months earlier in error for which they (managers) also repeatedly promised to reimburse me for (receipt was supplied to them as per their request) which has turned into a complete joke as I remind them of this every week to no avail. Sick of looking at gum stuck to machines for months at a time too (also brought to the attention of the staff on countless occasions). I have been a member for three and half years but clearly they rather piss off a loyal customer and worry about giving freebies to attract new member than retaining the ones they have. I will be leaving asap."
67,4268200,2018-11-07,1,"I had a heart attack and the doctors have said that I can no longer do any strenuous exercise - only light walking. I have talked to LA Fitness about my trainer payments and how I cannot train for a while and would like to put them on hold until I get the go ahead from the doctor. They would not comply. My husband even spoke to several managers and they would not even give any consideration to the situation. I had every intention of returning to the gym once I was feeling better and had the go ahead. But at this point I am so disgusted with how they behaved with us that I am not going to be going back and I want people to know how the experience. My lesson is be careful what you sign up for, because they will keep taking $300 from my account regardless of the situation."
68,4250363,2018-11-02,1,"Have had an LA Fitness multi club membership now for 7, almost 8 years. I purchased personal training for 1 year starting last year (pre pregnancy) from the club on Greenfield rd. and the 60 in Mesa, AZ. I have a lot of unused sessions left (38 total) and have paid for all of them in full over $2000. Well now I'm pregnant (18 weeks along) and have had horrible morning sickness until about 1 week ago and I don't feel like using personal training sessions during pregnancy and want to use them after my baby is born. Have gone through an enormous amount of phone calls to this gym, phone calls to member services, emails to member services, and apparently the VP of personal training denies my request to extend my personal training sessions that I have paid for. They wanted me to have a doctor's note stating I am ""completely unable to workout"" to extend my sessions. I'm not on bedrest, but I am pregnant. They then said my only option was to pay an EXTRA $45 a month to ""keep my personal training account active"". Apparently to them, being pregnant and associated symptoms like morning sickness, dizziness, etc. is not a valid reason for wanting to change up your activity level and fitness routine a bit and NOT have workouts with a personal trainer until you are feeling back to your normal self after your baby is born. Member Services will also never return your calls. I have been having to call them myself to follow up with my request.So now over $2000 of personal training sessions I have paid for are going to expire and I will have none left by the time my baby is born March of next year. Great for LA Fitness as they made all of that money off of me and have an unhappy customer and the only answer I get from member services is ""well you signed the contract, so"". Life changes and pregnancy changes a woman's body dramatically and the fact that a ""health and fitness"" club chooses not to acknowledge that and make an exception and keep a happy customer is so disappointing.I will keep my membership for now because I only pay $30 per month for multi club membership and kids club and you are unable to cancel your membership over the phone easily. Will take my time shopping for a new gym which has better customer service policies and will be switching when I am ready to up my workouts again after my baby is born. So disappointed and disgusted in this gym's customer service policies and the way I was treated throughout this whole process. Glad at least I am able to write this review to feel like I am able to express my concerns somewhere, because LA Fitness seems like they could care less."
69,4248407,2018-11-02,1,"It is absurd that I can't cancel membership over the phone. They require me to either come into the facility to cancel, or I need to download and print and mail a cancel form. (I haven't used a stamp in years). This does not surprise me... It is this level of customer care why I am canceling and going to another, more expensive gym."
70,4236329,2018-10-30,1,"My daughter went off to college and so I went online to cancel her membership because she cannot use it anymore. The website does not allow me to cancel her account online. After calling a support number, I was told that I have to come in between the hours of 9 to 5 and talk with an associate to cancel my daughter's membership. In this day and age to not have this basic feature online is obviously done on purpose. Shame on you LA Fitness!!!"
71,4233647,2018-10-29,1,"I signed up for the personal contract without noticed it was 12 months. And I told them I would love to try for a month to get me motivated as I am new to the gym too. The PT director told me I can cancel it anytime. The worst thing happened when I call to cancel for the second month. They said I have to buy out the cancelation which is $1300. When I signed the contract via electronic computer pad, nobody explain to me clearly the terms and conditions. All I heard that I can cancel my contract anytime. If they gave a clearly explanation just like when I called for cancel from the beginning, I would never signed up for any contract from them. Such a bad way to run a big business by making money from members and trapping people into a contract. Such a scam!"

I sat on the bench and crashed to the floor. As I screamed in pain and patrons rushed to my assistance two LA fitness employees ran from the area. I expected a return with help but no, they did not bother to even report to manager. I was taken to front desk where Ms. ** scanned my badge and took statements from me and witness. Two days later the statements were deleted from record. Their attorney responded with ""Even if LA fitness is negligent they rely on the member agreement to not be liable"". When asking a front desk clerk to get a manager she replied, ""It's a waste of time. They ignore everyone injured, we have an iron clad contract and will do nothing""."
73,4169939,2018-10-13,1,I went to the gym one day and the person at the check-in desk shined the laser right into me for a long period of time. I had to go to the eye doctor and was told that I have the beginning stages of glaucoma. Basically eye damage. I have contacted LA fitness and the police about the matter hoping it would stop. What happen is they move the people out and brought in new people and they are shining the light in my eyes too with smiles on their face. I don't want to have to explain any further about how rude and inconsiderate these people can be. I feel if this goes any further my eye will never heal.

They finally let me sign a cancellation form and they put it on his desk with a promise that an email will be sent in 24 hours. I return 24 hours later. The manager was there. He tells me that ""We don't do it that way. You'll have to mail it in. I don't have your forms"". I then ask for my signed forms back as I can't just leave my personal information (PI) in limbo"". He then says, ""Oh I have it (lie #1) but you have a balance"". I then ask what is the balance for? And he says ""For the Gym membership"". Which I thought was condescending as I wanted to know what time period was I being billed for. Anyways the whole conversation was just painful. He cut me off a few times as I was asking questions telling me to ""hold off"", ""wait"", ""I'm getting there"". Just rude impolite and condescending. He made me feel uncomfortable while people were walking in and out and in front of my husband. I will never go back to LA Fitness or recommend it to anyone. Respect and integrity are lacking. Such a shame!!"
75,4145138,2018-10-07,1,"Been a member for years. Every location I’ve been too (I travel the country for work) has been AWESOME. I just moved to Orlando and started working out the Goldenrod location. Today in the middle of my workout the assistant sales manager comes up, interrupts me and tells me I can have my gym bag on the floor. I tell him I’ll be with him after my set and he storms off like I did something to offend him. Then I go up to his desk to tell him I’ve been to several LAs and never had an issue. I asked if this rule was in my contract and he said it was a local rule. I told him I would need to cancel my membership then since this is part of how I workout and has my straps and intra workout shake and stuff in my bag and he says, ""No problem, happy to do that Monday with the GM."" I asked why he couldn’t help me since he was the assistant manager and he just says, ""Do that to the GM Monday."" Apparently I mean nothing to the gym at all and it really doesn't matter if I’ve been a repeat member for years. Pretty sad location."
76,4133390,2018-10-04,1,"I love the facility and enjoy my workouts there. The sub-standard customer service, however, is why I am writing this review. Over a dozen times, when checking in, the attendant behind the counter shined the laser scanner directly into my eyes just before scanning my membership card. Every time, I have asked them to please not point the scanner at my face and expose my eyes to the laser (I worked with lasers and laser safety for over thirty years). One individual, a manager there, I have asked now seven times as she continues to shine the laser into my eyes when checking in. This gross negligence continues to demonstrate not only a lack of concern for safety, but also a lack of respect and courtesy to LA Fitness members. After speaking with the General Manager about this problem (who witnessed today one of the aforementioned events) I was left with a feeling that my wishes and safety were an inconvenience."

I was recording myself for a personal vlog, suddenly the “manager” Skye ** came to me and in aggressive manner started to yell at me for my video. I told her that I recorded myself but still she forced me to delete the video. I tried to cancel my membership with another representative, but she start shouting again and told that only she can do a cancellation here. Then she proudly stated that she been a manager there for last 20 years and started to ask me: for how long do I live in the country (I have record of this discrimination). Worst customer service I had ever see."

At the time of admission they say if kids club is closed your kid can sit at reception but not to cross gym line but now when he some time sitting there they call us off. Also when I come half an hour before closing they don't allow me swimming pool. This is not fair. They have rules but they must show some courtesy in this regard.
79,4106831,2018-09-27,1,"Very bad cancellation policy. In the end, you definitely have to lose a few months payment. There are many salesperson to start a membership and there is only one operational person who can cancel your membership and he has his own timings."
80,4098578,2018-09-26,1,"Do NOT sign a personal trainer contract. The trainers are not very good or knowledgeable, especially if you are an older person. The cost is $299 upfront and then $200 per month for a half hour per week. This works out to be $100 per hour. Definitely way overpriced. The scheduling of the sessions was amateurish at best. Phone calls were not returned, messages left for the trainers were either not delivered or frequently not returned. At the end of the one year contract, LA FITNESS continues to charge the $200 per month unless you call and stop the thievery."
81,4071734,2018-09-19,1,"Finally I found some time to spend to talk about LA Fitness. If you know what to do at the gym, you know that LA Fitness offers a nice size pool, hot tube, free weights and work out machines zones for a reasonable price. I was a member for around 7 years with two different plans, first one was regular yearly contract and the last one was multiclub three years contract. On my first experience at the place they tried to sell me their personal training program. (misleading sale that I will need to make a separate review about it, is a trap without way out).Cleaning is something that they don't care at all. For several years, me and several other customers, even after multiples complaints to all managers that worked there, last one was David, nothing changed. The place it is filthy including the pool and spa hot tube. So the true about the Legionnaires' bacteria, yes the one that cause Legionnaires' disease that was found there was not unexpected, was not a surprise to me. So what was reasonable before, now you may put your health in jeopardy. You got what you pay! looks that is their motto!Keep in mind that it is not just your health that is in jeopardy, also your physical integrity is in risk! Most of the nights are crowded and they made the only area available to stretch and abs in the gym as personal training only. Nobody does personal trainer there, little percentage. So you have rush hour times without a proper place to start your work out and due to that, one day after my workout I decided to talk with one of the managers available at the time,(Andrea), the same whom upgraded my membership to multiclub (you can go to any la fitness in florida, not signatures ones), and she allow me to use the personal training area that most of the time nobody uses anyways for stretches only.So next day, was a Tuesday night, the place packed as always. Directed myself to stretch with my headphones on lying on the mat when the trainer(Michael P.) show up in my face with a bad physiognomy and gesticulating. When I took my headphone off, I heard this angry guy telling me to leave the area immediately, so when I tried to explain why I was there, he grabbed the mat holder and tried to make me rollover off from the mat, so I placed my right hand on the floor and I bounced back pushing his arms and knees away from me with my left hand and stood up. Told him to not touch me or try to move me physically again. When I stood up I was able to see two students and the two surge lights that I always thought that was security cameras on the end of the stretching area, I didn't know until later that they were his students. He probably thought that I was a little boy. I may look young and very skinny but I'm almost 40 years old with martial arts experience on my background, so I faced him and with all the calm in the world said that his behavior wasn't right.At this point with no witness around, just his students, he called the janitor guy that was leaving the restrooms on me, big guy, telling him to kick me out the gym so I face him too stating that nobody will touch me, he threat me and screamed at me thinking that I will be scared but never did anything and he apologized to me later because he didn't really know what was happening. He thought that I did something really bad because the way that the trainer spoke with him.So when physical threat was not a threat to me anymore, because people started to go in and out of the restrooms, I walked to the front desk to ask for the manager but no managers available at the gym on that time. Another bad thing, rush hour and nobody responsible at the place. The trainer percepts the situation that he caused. So I'm at the front desk when he came with his students on his side saying that he will call the cops on me if I don't leave. Well, guess what? I didn't leave so he called the cops and I waited for the cops to arrive. On this meantime they were talking on one of the desks on a way that looks like they knew each other from a very long time(body language) , looks that they were putting their version together.When the cops arrived, the cop spoke with him first because he called and right after with his students and then me. The personal trainer created a such bad scene that I requested to speak with the cop outside due to the many curious people there. Everybody curious to know why cops were inside there. So when I told what happened, he told me that they provided a different story. So independent who said what, I decided to cancel my membership anyways and I expressed to the cop what I would like to do. So he went inside and when he came back he said that unfortunately they don't have managers available. Because it is a contract for three years just made. Arrived next day to talk about the situation with manager David that at first was sounding helpful but then after I tell him what happened, and he said that what the personal trainer and his students told him were different. They said that I was standing and pushed him on his chest with both arms starting the issue. Detail: I was on the ground when he tried to move me and when I pushed him.I don't want to pass as a liar because his teacher has two witnesses on his side and I had just the true. So I requested the footage from the security cameras to show who is who on this story but no cameras available.On this situation that I don't have how to prove nothing, I decided to cancel my membership anyways but then he said that I have a contract and the managers at corporate will need to approve that, they may revoke the membership and keep the money, so I just said that really don't matter at all to me what they will do with my membership, I will not use, I'm done with LA Fitness anyways and I want my money back. My membership for three years was almost $800.00.After I spoke with the gym manager I decided to call corporate and there they treat me really bad, they were probably thinking that I was that very bad guy that they heard it about. On my third call I was able to talk with one of the managers and she confirmed of course the refund. Good choice La Fitness! I will never allow you to keep that money.As a very responsible person, I will stand for what is right and not allow to be bullied by any personal trainer or nobody. Martial arts teach you how to protect yourself but more than this I learned to have a very strong self control. I will never start immature situations like this one.Bottom of line: BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE NOT SAFE IN GENERAL AT LA Fitness. They lost me, a old client and many others due to the lack of security, hygiene, and behavior of their employees."
82,4063832,2018-09-18,1,"Beware of signing the contracts with the trainers. There is a $200 fee for just signing and it is a yearly contract with many hidden clauses, like when it expires it automatically renews monthly at a much higher rate. The manager admittedly said a customer should be notified by email when the contract is expired, as they notify every promotional sign up by email but this was a 'corporate decision.' Mine overlapped just before I went into a frozen membership for 3 months (out of state) and they still did not alert me when I went to freeze the membership. Very, very poor customer service with constant changing of management. Stick to the basics and double read anything you sign."

Everybody has 30 days to cancel except these guys. 3 day window otherwise you're stuck for a year. I sent in a written cancellation just like the contract said but because it wasn't received within a 3 day time window they declined it. I switched their payment to a prepaid debit card. They went in to debit a payment every couple of days. I decided I will pay it & not complain but seeing them deducting a payment every few days was ridiculous. Thank god I used a prepaid card or else my bank would have slammed me with NSF fees. I call to make a payment & they tell me my account is frozen. I'm trying to give them $ but they say, ""Call back talk to a mgr."" This place needs to be investigated for unfair consumer practices. Now I have to chase down a mgr to give her a payment. Again stay away. This place is a joke. After I signed up the sales guy didn't answer my text or calls for questions. What a coincidence. If you look for a reputable gym LA FITNESS is a scam."
85,4028834,2018-09-10,1,"How the management cheated me out of $1940 and I got nothing in return for it. They signed me up for personal training and didn’t even give me a single session. I was calling for a month and the trainers wouldn’t answer. I stopped the credit cards payment after 4 month of getting nothing. But when we went to court the judge sided with LA Fitness because I signed their bogus contracts. They promise you the world but delivers nothing, don’t sign their contract. It’s only to protect them and screw you."
86,4004318,2018-09-04,1,"I've been a member for years and satisfied. I decided to get help from a trainer. When I inquired by sitting down with a trainer, he went through the contract. It was good I came on the 15th of the month because I could get some free sessions! He went through the pages of the contract each with long paragraphs and no time to read them. When I attempted to ask questions, he said we have to speed along or the computer will ""time out"" and we will have to start over. I had to initial or sign at least 6 times - ?? just to get a trainer?? I decide the next day to cancel out. The system is set up to prevent an easy cancellation process; have to show up in person, fill out a website form (not easily found), write a letter to the California office, etc. It is a year contract, if you leave early, you have to pay 50% of the annual cost. Beware."
87,3984024,2018-08-29,1,"My husband joined LA Fitness in Casa Grande, Arizona several months ago under the Silver Sneakers program. He is disabled from a stroke, requires a wheelchair and constant attendance by either myself or his in home caregiver. The three of us went on the initial tour together and one of the most important questions that we asked was about bathroom access. My husband needs help to get on and off the toilet, change clothes, etc. We were assured that would not be a problem. We were instructed to use either the women's or men's locker room bathrooms by just announcing man coming through or woman coming through. And we're also shown the family bathroom in the children's area that was wheelchair accessible. On August 2nd, my husband attended the 1100 Silver Sneakers class with his uniformed caregiver. At one point he had an urgent need to go to the restroom, which sometimes happens as a consequence of his stroke. My husband and his caregiver were denied access to the men's restroom, they were denied access to the women's restroom, and they were denied access the family bathroom because there were kids in the play area. The staff did not even attempt to offer alternatives or empathize with my husband's situation. As a consequence of this delay, my husband suffered the humiliating experience of soiling himself in public with urine and stool and then had to travel home without being able to clean up and change. Due to this experience my husband will not be returning to LA Fitness. We have found another gym in town, 24/7 Fitness, that is very accommodating and truly friendly."

But, guess what turns out they never let their members out that easily. You have to go to the facility and cancel. And the worst part is if you go in person, they keep giving lame reason (and every person responsible for cancellation will fall sick) until you give up and let them keep charging you. Worst cancellation process ever. It's not only about having good facilities and friends staff. It's about making the process easy for the consumers. Never joining them again."

It was put on a freeze and has for 1 YEAR NOW being charging me a 10.00 freeze hold fee and will NOT refund my money because I didn't bring this to their attention! Really?! No your fine staff made the error of when I canceled putting it on Freeze instead. I didn't call/bring to their attention in the past year because as I said I CANCELLED this and do not watch my credit card that by the way is CANCELLED NOW TOO for a 10.00 fee that should of NEVER been taken out monthly. The manager I talked to at corporate said nothing she could do because they charged me and I didn't bring to their attention - this is not my fault really?! WOW great job LA Fitness, great customer service! Then I ask to speak to a different manager as she is not assisting me correctly and puts me on hold for 10 minutes then I get disconnected. Really the worst gym all around, price is ridiculous, gym is always packed and you can never get on anything, never clean, customer service has ALWAYS been terrible.

90,3971472,2018-08-26,1,I joined LA Fitness due to convenience closer to my house. I belong to another gym at the moment. LA Fitness charges more. They claim not to have contracts. Two weeks out I decided to cancel. Did your other gym was much better less expensive and an overall better experience there. I've told LA Fitness every two weeks over the phone not to charge me anymore that I have canceled several times. Only way they allow you to cancel is if you go in and fill forms out to cancel. As long as I don't go in till continue charging me although I've told him I don't authorize them to. Every time I tell him I'm going to record the conversation informing them of the canceled they hang up on me. If it's not month-to-month why am I still being charged after I tell them I do not want to use their facility. I work during the week and not able to go in to cancel. And on the weekends their manager is not there that does a cancellations. I think all this is pre-designed to take customers money. Somebody needs to look into all this. Do not give them your debit card and allow them to deduct the money you can't stop them. I hope somebody reads this and it helps them out before they make a mistake that I've made. Funny but I thought all companies that take advantage if people were gone. Guess I don't have a lot of wisdom.
91,3940332,2018-08-18,1,"I had the most unpleasant experience swimming in LA Fitness Randolph pool. A manager named Andrew has still not responded to my complaint two days later. The pH in the pool was so acidic that my eyes, skin and throat began to burn during my swim. I thought the pool water was safe. Found out it had not been tested in 2 days! 30 minutes later they still continues to allow people to swim in it. It was only after I left that I heard they closed it. I could not breathe the rest of the day without coughing. How can they pass health inspection if they don't know how to monitor their pool?"
92,3931386,2018-08-15,1,"Be careful about considering this membership. Yes they have contracts, but when to signup of just talk to their sales staff they will lie to you about benefits.

93,3907041,2018-08-07,1,"When I signed up for membership in 03/18, I thought we would be using facility close to my office. However, I was told that the facility next to my office will be going thru repairs and will be shut down for 2-3 weeks. LA Fitness advisors wanted me to go to facility which was inconvenient to where I lived and was not close to my office. When we signed up for membership, they added an extra month's fee to the charge that we were to pay. LA Fitness said that this fee would be used to pay for your last month. I thought that this extra payment would pay the non payment of dues. Our experience has not been good with this fitness center. We only went to facility one time before repairs: pool was dirty; I could not find anyone to show me how to use the machines as promised; staff was not friendly. I decided then that I did not want to come back. When I went to cancel in May, I had already accumulated 2 months of back dues. I totally believe that this company is a rip-off. I will never go back into another LA Fitness center."

I was given appointments to training and no trainer showed up, then I told them I wanted to cancel because of the horrible service and they refused to.

They never gave me the options of cancelling. I called and said, ""No. Look. I am cancelling."" I was still charged. This is fraud behaviour. I have cancelled everything here and put a block on my account for them. Do not go here. They are compete scammers!"
98,3833452,2018-07-13,2,"I have belonged to LA Fitness for several years. 1. Oversell memberships so clubs are crowded during peak hours. 2. No privacy in locker rooms. Cell phones with cameras everywhere. 3. Incompetent staff in black uniforms imitating athletic trainers but only salesmen. 4. No orientation to properly use machines.5. ""FREE"" fitness evaluation is scam, to sell you a CONTRACT for fitness services. 6. Staff target elderly members (like me) who have belonged to gyms (like YMCA) and can spot abuse, and manipulation of fat girls and boys. 7. Staff will walk around club trying to spot sales suckers, and let garbage stay on floor for days. Garbage cans overflow. Bathrooms need cleaning, 8. Many clubs have NO WI-FI so you cannot watch sports, do office work or school work while you work out. Idea is to get you to leave. 9. Never have on TV's local news stations, local sport events, no NBA, NHL, NFL, golf, soccer that better private clubs have for members to watch while they work-out. 10. Advertise children's centers and then close them after young families sign-up. 11. Advertise juice bar and have none.12. Constantly BLAST loud info commercials or rap music, and it's the same music every day. Everyone uses earbuds to stay sane. 13. Many machines LOOK like they have connection to radio or TV but it's all broken or not connected. 14. Staff will lie and deny there is a problem if you complain, 15. Make sure all machines are working before you join. 16. Many advertised classes never happen. Instructors are always quitting. Look for how long people have worked at a club. ALWAYS ask for experience and training when club personnel talk to you. Use these 16 points as a checklist."

The employees (salesperson-manager) are rude, immature and have No respect or any type of professionalism. They make fun of members so loud and ignorant that they don't even care for the members to hear. My wife and I have shared our concerns with them and basically, they say, ""No worries. We will work with that."" You turn your back and again 0.00 respect. In 12 years we never saw a team of employees so immature with not even moral principles or use their FREE common sense given by nature. It feels for us to be paying for a membership for a NASTY SEPTIC TANK and in top of that been bully and abuse by the same employees in a really (negative and **, indecent, **, salacious, dirty, filthy, **, explicit, lewd, rude, vulgar, coarse, crude, offensive, immoral, improper, impure, degenerate, depraved, debauched) environment from the same employees.

101,3797704,2018-06-29,1,"I was in a city for one month so I needed a gym membership for just 1 month. The closest gym was a LA fitness, I went into the office and made my intention clear (one month membership). The sales associate let me know that he was signing me up for month-to-month and I'd need to call to cancel. Fast forward, my month is over. I call the location to cancel. I'm told I need to show up in person to cancel. I demand my original sales associate who denies ever saying that. Finally, I drive to another LA fitness location just to cancel. After some tinkering with the computer, I'm told I'd need to call headquarters and that for some reason he doesn't have permission to cancel my account. So I call headquarters, after getting some runaround I need to cancel by mail, the person notifies me that they canceled my account and I should get some email confirmation. I hang up, and go about my day. Only several hours later do I realize that email confirmation never came. I tell myself if I see a charge on my CC I will then cancel my card. Fast forward, and I look at my statement and do indeed see a $34.99 charge from LA fitness. I immediately call the merchant demanding an explanation and after another run-around (mail in to cancel) I just cancel my card and tell my bank that the $34.99 charge is fraud.Fast forward and I get a phone call from LA fitness associate asking me to update my card details. I tell the associate I canceled my membership and don't want them to bother me anymore. She politely tells me she will put a note in my file so I'm never called again. Today I was just called by another LA fitness associate asking me to update my card details. I told him I canceled my membership and he began to tell me my membership wasn't canceled and I needed to mail in a letter blah blah blah. I hung up on him. At this point I'll just take the minor ding on my credit report if they send it to collections. But this is a warning to the prospective user not to enroll with LA fitness. I thought that certainly a large company wouldn't engage in such shady practices. I was wrong."
102,3763471,2018-06-20,2,"I have been trying to use my United Health Care membership to enjoy a 50% discount on my membership. L.A. Fitness is the only gym nationwide to insist on using an online form to receive this discount. I have been misdirected to 3 different websites to complete my registration and each website more frightful than the previous. I get booted off each site; my passwords are not accepted; etc. I have gone to the club and the manager could not even fill out the online forms. L.A. Fitness also lied to me about the temperature of their pool. I am disabled and need a warm-water exercise pool. I was told that the pool would be 84 and 85 degrees. When I first joined, the temperature was exactly that. After Christmas, the pool was changed to 80 degrees, maybe 81. My friends and I called different clubs nationwide. All pools were kept at 84 degrees, which is perfect. Our manager refuses to raise the temperature to comply with their initial pitch. I believe that this club is trying to help the lap swimmers who want a colder pool.One pool cannot be all things to all people. Warm water or not; be honest. There are also more people in the aqua program than lap swimmers. Our classes have about 40 people a class. Or used to; many have dropped out. One gal became sick with bronchitis due to the chilly conditions. I have to wear a unitard in the pool with a shirt over it in order to do my workout. I hope that something can be done to help me with both of my problems."
103,3733846,2018-06-11,3,If you're joining a gym for classes this is the wrong one. But most of them have a pool and a sauna. The machines are good and in good working order too. But it would be great if it had more classes that are more throughout the day.
104,3733885,2018-06-10,3,"Age and condition of machines is very inconsistent from Club to Club. Same goes with the variety and caliber of machines. Clubs would be great if they stayed open later, especially over the weekends."
105,3722101,2018-06-08,2,"I spent over 7 years working out here and have been to most of the gyms in the Mpls/St. Paul/metro area. The biggest glaring issue for me at these places was rampant theft. I had my locker broken into at least once a year. At the LA in Mpls uptown almost every locker had streaks from hammers scraping into them from people breaking the locks. The staff plays completely aloof to any problems and feigns concern. The last theft I witnessed had me consoling a 90 year old man whose wallet had been emptied out. I was so upset I angrily confront the manager at the Inver Grove Heights location for a good 15 minutes. They have no plan or commitments to stop the issue. They just shrug it off. The old man never came back. At one point (and my last straw) people were using the showers as their personal toilet leaving the remains behind. The curtains had to be stripped off to stop the problem. This is a big health hazard and the staff alerted no one! We had to demand to know why we didn’t have curtains anymore. One of the newer staff finally spilled the beans.Due to its low cost you get low quality membership along with the ‘great deal’. Lots of roughnecks due to the cheap monthly dues and it bred a culture of theft real quick. Numerous times I pulled up to the club to see car windows shattered out at the Edina MN club. I learned to leave nothing in my locker but clothes as the break-ins were so common. Eventually as I got older I decided the cheap monthly dues aren’t worth people using the showers as toilets, that was my breaking point. I promptly switched to Lifetime Fitness, clean, safe, friendly. Complete 180 from LA fitness, I’m not a poor college kid anymore. I didn’t need to put up with the sloppy management.Staff turn over rate is terrible of course, I always refused personal trainers and “free trials” but I’ve heard horror stories of people getting tricked into contracts. All in all it’s a bad place to be at. Never worked out at one that didn’t have theft issues. If you’re strapped for cash it’s ok, but leave any valuables locked in the glovebox of your car!"
106,3733873,2018-06-08,3,"Guys enter sauna directly from working out without showering wearing their workout clothes and socks and are permitted to do so. Very disgusting. And just recently put a sign up that said ""No Shoes"" because they were actually just walking in the sauna fully clothed in some instances, some still walk in fully dressed in street garbs that they work out in as all don't use workout uniforms."
107,3733870,2018-06-07,4,"The gym is new and well equipped but there is a lack of friendliness from the staff. During the winter the temp inside was kept around 67-68F, most people wear sweaters and long pants."

That is a lie. The 1st 20 min is a free consultation. They make you sign a contract and it costs anywhere from $240 to 600 a month! To have someone that's barely in shape show me how to do things I could teach them. Buyer beware if you cancel because you figure it out too late. It's $800 to $1200 off of whatever card you left on file."
109,3733876,2018-06-06,3,1st - they don’t enforce the rules for the saunas. People enter saunas with their shoes & clothing on. 2nd - the charge to use multiple locations they should allow you two selections. Much more...
110,3707107,2018-06-03,1,"I never had a problem with the membership, but the personal training was a disaster! In total I paid $4,000 dollars. I had an accident and broke my tailbone, so I wasn't able to use my training sessions. When I contacted LA fitness to see what my options were I was rudely surprised my options were basically none. I was told if I canceled I would have 30 days to use the training sessions I ALREADY PAID FOR!! I continued to pay for the training, but dropped down to 1 session a week, and I felt like that was all I could do because I didn't want to lose the 104 sessions I had accumulated. I asked if I could give the sessions to a family member with a membership... NO! I asked if they could extend the 30 days so I wouldn't have to keep paying for session... NO!! THEY GAVE ME NO CHOICES!! LA FITNESS is a scam. I've lost upwards of 6000 until finally I canceled the training sessions, and lost 104 training sessions and LA fitness just said ""oh well."" Be WARY. They will take your money and leave you with nothing!!"
111,3733900,2018-06-03,4,"I like working out and keeping a tone, attractive shape. I like knowing that it weight will come off and stay off, with whatever my shape is. I like to see results, within weeks, and or months, and being notified I have reach my goal, and see it in a mirror."
112,3733849,2018-06-02,1,The Staff is non-existent. Nobody to help with machines. Staff lets people bring backpacks on to the gym floor. Jacuzzi usually needs cleaning. Nobody monitors the dressing rooms or informs ladies how be behave in a public setting. Lot of ** and ** around showing off tattoos. I am looking for another gym to workout in - something more upper class.
113,3733915,2018-06-02,5,LA fitness has facilities all over the Atlanta area which is very convenient for me. And all of the facilities are very nice with lots of equipment.

115,3697193,2018-05-31,1,"My partner has been members of this club for several years and I joined almost two years ago. During one of her first visits at least three years ago, she was approached by a trainer who preceded to follow her throughout the gym while making unsolicited comments which made her very uncomfortable. She asked him several times to leave her alone as she was not interested in his training. After several attempts, she finally had to raise her voice and demand that he leave her alone. As she left that day, she reported the incident to a manager. Since then, she has had no contact with the trainer other than being on the receiving end of some dirty looks. Today (several years after the initial incident), as we were leaving the gym, the same trainer verbally attacked my partner and I because she ""made eye contact"" with him. Two desk employees and a manager witnessed the event as well as several customers. The manager spoke to us and told us he would speak with the trainer. I'll be the first to admit that after the trainer angrily approached me, I lost my temper and my voice rose back at him. The manager assured me he would look into it and call me after he had spoken with the trainer. He never called. The manager also told me that he is new to this location (LA Fitness - Denton TX) and he was sent there to ""clean it up"" and improve client relations. Any manager with a lick of sense would have fired that employee on the spot without the need for ""talking."" It is obvious that that type of behavior is acceptable to this company at the expense of lost clientele and reputation. We are discontinuing our memberships immediately but I'm sure we'll have a nightmare with billing and termination."
116,3696388,2018-05-31,1,"I signed up for Per Training. If you wish to cancel you only have a 3 day window, not the common 30 days. I therefore went to the website to temporarily defer payments, there is no such option. You can freeze your gym membership not the personal training. If you are experiencing financial hardship, medical issue or loss of employment they will continue to bill you. LA Fitness is a scam. I highly encourage stay away from this gym. The salespeople don't care about you. After I signed up the sales guy wouldn't return my calls or text re: questions I had on my account or gym. Wham Bam Thank you Maam!"
117,3733855,2018-05-31,3,They need to paint and replace the carpet badly. The place looks old and tired. The equipment is often not functioning properly and the maintenance staff appears to always be working. I think they might need to hire a few new people.
118,3733924,2018-05-30,2,"It was great to go swimming there, convenient hours. Unfortunately, it is very filthy. The showers were always full of hair with mold on the tile. The hallway leading to the pool has a strong urine smell and the floors are black with filth since they are never scrub. The Jacuzzi needs a shock treatment and like the pool needs deep cleaning. The filters to the pool are full of mold. It is very common to see members in the pool with their regular clothes instead of a swimsuits."
119,3733891,2018-05-28,4,Nasty manager but nice staff. Gym is nicest I’ve been to but no good extra classes & times. Gym threatens to charge $10/mo for towels to seniors who’s membership is covered by Medicare insurance.

So, to have access to the cancellation form you must have signed up with LA Fitness directly."
122,3614668,2018-05-08,1,"Upon joining LA Fitness with two other family members 2 months ago, we received the high pressure sales pitch for the services of a personal trainer. We discussed that it would probably be a good idea to have someone help us out during the first couple of months to make sure we knew how to properly use the equipment so we could make the best use of our time. The sales person was quick to agree and said they would get us signed up. I was then directed to sign a little small signature screen and was told that by signing the electronic pad I would be agreeing to the training we had just spoke about. In hindsight, I was stupid to trust them, but we were excited to get started, so I gave them my credit card information and signed the little screen. We have been very happy with our trainer, but we are ready now to go solo. Long story short: We were signed up for 8 sessions per month for 12 months at more than 350 dollars per month. With 10 months remaining! We had made it clear that we only wanted the services of a trainer for two or three months, but we're signed up for an entire year. They will not let us out of the training package even though I explained how we do not want, nor never intended to purchase a 12 months package. They want 1,800 dollars to buy out the remainder of the year. We went from being happy customers to being totally infuriated. They are completely heartless, and could not care less about misrepresenting themselves. I was referred to a corporate office and received the same response as many have described here. I really wish I had read these complaints before signing up.The only thing I can do now is to use every opportunity to warn people away from these most unscrupulous practices that are obviously part of their corporate culture of dishonesty. Take my advice and be very careful what you sign; you would actually do well to avoid them completely."
123,3596170,2018-05-03,1,"I recently attained a pass for LA Fitness and as it expired I decided to join. However, I had trouble with my debit card so I wasn't able to complete the process. The manager told me to go ahead with my workout then finish the transaction. I was in the sauna about 10-15 minutes and noticed my skin started to feel like needles were sticking in me. It was if I was being boiled. I left out and when I took my clothes off my arms were really hot and I had red spots everywhere. I felt nauseous and light headed. The sauna was above 192 degrees but the outside informational says 180 degrees. I informed the front desk and left. The doctor said I had heat exhaustion and could have had a heat stroke. Advised me not to go back until the temperature is correct. I contacted LA Fitness and to my surprise they said that their sauna is fine. This company cares nothing about its guest. Will not return."
124,3595873,2018-05-03,1,"LA fitness has to be the most unprofessional job I ever tried to apply for. I was told to be at the interview by 1 pm so I arrived at 12:45 and they had me waiting for 45 mins before anyone greeted me or asked what I was there for, so I got up and told management, ""Please don't forget about me"" and still had to wait 30 mins after that for the interview. When I finally got to speak to someone it was some guy who works at the front desk and not even management. He asked me how he could apply for Uber once he realized I made more money during the interview then lied to the manager say we was discussing the job when she finally arrived. The manager didn't really ask me anything and just read the resume I provided, So I started asking questions and in the middle of the interview random customers came up and interrupted the whole process because they don't even have a room to interview people in. Long story short after the interview I decided I can't work at such an unorganized and cringy place. THE INTERVIEW WAS A JOKE! Do better LA fitness. Get new management that cares."
125,3547870,2018-04-18,1,"04/18/18 I just signed up at one of your LA fitness locations (do note even have a id number I am so new). To say this was an underwhelming experience would be an understatement. There was one person at the desk and she was doing very well with a customer that was unhappy. When she found out that I needed to sign up she called someone over who helped me sign up. The annoyed customer started talking with him. I was finally signed up and I had the feeling he was going to walk away. I asked, ""Can I hire a trainer on a case to case basis."" I was informed they have 6 and 12 month programs. He asked someone else (a trainer) to help me. While we waited for the trainer to get off of the phone this person's attention was everywhere but with me. He was looking around. I tried talking to him but his demeanor indicated he really had no interest in me. I have been in customer service for over 40 years. This was a major error in customer service. The person you are with gets your undivided attention!The trainer got off the phone and introduced himself. High pressure sales right away. I asked (5 times) when I come in for the first time and just want to work out on my own will someone show me how to use the equipment. While I was not directly told no, I was told how the trainers will come up with a program for me. We did this 5 times and got nowhere. It seems incredulous that a new customer is not shown (at the least) on how to adjust weights, how to secure weights so they do not fall off, how to use the equipment so you do not get injured (using the machine incorrectly). Not getting anywhere I finally resorted to asking this person where is the bathroom, what does each kind of equipment do. His reply was, ""I can show you around.""This took all of 3 minutes. As we walked he said, ""this machine if for your legs, this one for your back, etc."" Upstairs we have the simple machines for cardio? I made sure that I understood that means bicycles and treadmills. He said yes. He showed me where the showers were. I told him I did not need to see the locker room just where is it. After this ""tour"" he was asking when he can call me, and if Monday is ok.What should have happened was about 15 to 20 minutes spent, telling me how to ""use"" each machine safely and correctly, what parts of the body they build up, etc. I came in excited to be trying this and left very disappointed, to the extent I may find another place that actually cares about their customers and does not see them as dollar signs. I feel that this attitude is prevalent throughout your entire organization. I came in under the silver sneaker program and will pass this along to Humana. What is noteworthy is that I had come in last year to just ask for some information and was greeted with the exact same high pressure sales tactics."
126,3531064,2018-04-13,1,"Wanted to spread some awareness on LA Fitness Scam! My brother & I recently signed up for services with LA Fitness & was charged $208.98 for Signup (which seems reasonable I guess). We were then talked into getting a Personal Trainer service. As we were discussing numbers on a piece of paper we were told the package would include a full year of training, 2 times a week for 30 min each session and would be charged $419. I agreed for that price I would sign up for those services. Among signup, the contract was summarized to us & I was asked to sign on an electronic signature platform. May I point out, the sales rep never once mentioned “monthly prices” or a cancellation policy therefore we assumed it would be the same as the normal membership policy which we were told we could cancel at anytime. Now lets fast forward. A month later, I receive another charge on my card for $320 from LA Fitness. I call them for an explanation & was told I was paying $320 MONTHLY for the service. I remained calm & explained to the employee that I was misinformed about pricing being told I was paying for a year & if that’s the case would like to cancel. She tells me I need to talk to the Manager to cancel & that he was busy so would call me back. I continued to call throughout the week & one of the employees informed me he “said he already spoke to me” which was a lie! & would call me back. No call. Now I’m realizing some avoidance. I call again 2 days later & talked to a different manager & was told he would reach out to the Vice President to see what they can do & call me back. A week goes by with no phone call so I call once again for an update. The same manager answers & transfers me to the guy who signed us up. I begin to explain the issue & ask why it turned into a monthly charge & all he could say is “I signed the documents”. “I should’ve read the documents & had 72 hours to cancel”. I then explained to him I could not afford the $320 a month as I am a single mother struggling as it is & he continues to say there is nothing he can do since I signed the contract. I responded asking if when the company puts me in debt & I provide paperwork to prove it, is that when they will cancel my membership?! What does the jerk say?! “Oh let me notate the account that you are going through hardships so when that DOES happen, we can see what we can do.” What in the heck!!! All he cares about is his Commission he made off the scam! I’m fed up at this point & call corporate. I explain what happened & my option was to pay them $1,600 & they will cancel the membership. That is insane!! They said if I cannot provide proof there is nothing they can do. Now how am I supposed to get proof? By strapping a camera to myself anytime I want to sign up for something? I call my bank & tell them the situation & they change my card number & I send in a cancellation form to LA Fitness Corporate & receive a confirmation that the account has been cancelled! Now it’s April, got my new card & I check my bank account & somehow they manage to charge the new card an additional $320 WITH THE ACCOUNT CLOSED! Decided to google reviews to see if anyone else had dealt with this same issue to maybe gain some support or advice on what they are doing to fix it & I came across MANY reviews of people that got hit with the same exact scam!!! Sales agent tells them they are paying a year of services & turns into a monthly payment! Of course by the time they find out it’s too late! Something must be done!!!"

And finally trying 1 months I meet a manager; one of the rudest person seen. Try to talk about situations. He is like, “You have to pay more 100$ cause we can’t cancel before 6 months.” Paid 100$ plus for 4 months club and personal training of 25 min session of 4 times.

The managers that are supposed to assist ""fix"" everything are never present. Storytime: Cameron, the former Personal Training Director of the Missouri Club, sold my brother and me on packages for 8 personal training sessions per month for $160/month. That sounds like a good deal, so we went with it. However, Cam would always schedule an extra session with us off the books with him, then one with another trainer on the books. We found out later the contract was actually for 4 sessions/$160/month. He did not honor his originally stated agreement. Now we are stuck paying for something that was not a part of what we had agreed to with Cam, because he promised us something that was not true. How he explained this contract was incorrect. They allow their employees to lie, then do not care if their lies hurt people financially. Cameron's boss was supposed to contact me, and never has. My credit card keeps getting pinged for $160 even though I was told by one of their reps in the corporate office it was canceled and I would no longer be charged. There is another lie. I have yet to be contacted by an actual manager.

I ended up frustrated and canceled everything I had with them. I would never trust or pay for any personal trainer again.
132,3484189,2018-03-29,1,"Yesterday after my workout I returned to the gym locker room to find my lock had been cut and my belongings (including wallet with cash, credit cards, ID, cell phone and keys) unsecured. I went to the front desk and spoke to Mike who said he was the gym manager. He told me that he cut the lock by mistake. I asked him why he just left my belongings unsecured. He said he was going to put a note on my locker, but didn’t explain why he just left my things. He was less than apologetic, and I asked to talk to his supervisor. He wrote a number down and handed it to me. I called the number which turned out to be a call center in California. I have made several phone call and sent emails to the LA Fitness and have gotten the runaround or no response at all. Very poor management and customer service."
133,3463594,2018-03-23,1,"The gym itself and the equipment is good but the problem with this LA Fitness location is the management. I set up an appointment with the fitness manager to see about getting glute/leg workouts and a few sessions to run me through the workouts. LA Fitness doesn’t offer anything other than a 6 month commitment and I don’t need that much personal training as I’ve been lifting for years. Since no options fit my needs the manager and I decided that we’d trade me doing her lashes (lash extensions) in exchange for a few PT sessions and workouts. (Which is usually grounds for instant termination if an employee does this especially a PT manager.) I then fulfilled my part of the agreement and gave her a full set of lash extensions and I got 2 PT sessions with her. I then proceeded to ask for my workouts be given to me for 7 weeks!!! I had nothing but lip service as to how busy she was at work and just couldn’t find time to do it. After asking for 5 weeks for the workouts and the manager saying she just doesn’t have time to write my workouts up and constantly apologizing and that she WILL get them to me. My husband is leaving the gym and looks over at her as she’s taking selfies at her desk not working at all. So apparently she’s not too busy that she can take selfies then doing her clients workouts. She looks at my husband and says I’ll get them done right now! And apologizes. Again. And once again, a week later nothing from her. So, we go in and ask to talk to the general manager, but the Ops manager asked what our concern was. So we explain everything to her and don’t get much out of her other then taking our number down and said she’d call us.So we wait and after 5 days no call and doesn’t even try and address our concern when we come into the gym. So, once again I go in and ask for the GM and talk to him. The kid literally doesn’t know what or how to handle the issue because he asks me what he should do. So, he says he’ll talk to the Fitness manager about it and he’ll talk to me the next day when I come lift. I go in the next day and talk to him and his solution was that he told Sarah to give me workouts and she’ll get ahold of me. I explain to him for 6 weeks she’s been telling me that same thing and never does. So he says I’ll talk to her when she gets back at 4 again and tell her to get back to you. Which I know will go nowhere because she’s been avoiding me. So I decide to get ahold of the VP and sent her a text about my issue. Her solution is to have her pay me for partial services I did for her.I am absolutely amazed that they allow someone to be a manager that doesn’t conduct themselves as someone in management should and they obviously have no business being a manager. They have management ripping people off and the managers don’t even know how to deal with situations like this. So BE AWARE. LA Fitness lets their staff steal from not only them but their MEMBERS and nothing comes from it. I am disgusted as to how the ENTIRE management staff handled this situation! I will be canceling my membership and going somewhere else where management actually cares about their members."
134,3459703,2018-03-22,1,Very dissatisfied with televisions on Fox News. A neutral station such as CNN or NBC or ABC would be fine but I do not enjoy listening to propaganda as I work out and I will not renew membership. I asked them to turn station and they would not. I complained to corporate office and I kid called back having done no research and said they do not control television stations. The facility is not clean and this just pushed me out the door after 23 of fitness membership at Bally then LA Fitness I can do better.
135,3458116,2018-03-22,1,"Husband with the membership went in October to the front desk to show dates of his upcoming deployment. He was told billing would not happen November and his account would be on hold. November called when the first monthly payment went in... told it would be refunded. December same issue. January again... & this time asked if I should go in with his orders. February AGAIN!! Today, I get an alert they are doing it again. Right now!! 5 months and he is truly deployed!!"
136,3455245,2018-03-21,1,"If I could give LA Fitness zero stars I would. First of all, WAY TOO PUSHY for signing contracts. I know they love that money but their approach doesn’t give people time to think. I’m sure that’s what they’re going for but they’ll keep ending up with people like me, who are pissed off and telling everyone how awful they are. Trainer canceled on me multiple times, which is whatever but he seemed to be one of the only trainers there, and always had a packed schedule (so it was hard to have any options). When I told him I was canceling due to financial reasons and school starting up, he said, “So you’re giving up your fitness goals for school?” Yeah, I am because I work 1.5 hours away from home full time and I’m in school full time. I don’t have time anymore for the training. I also can’t afford it as I’m financially independent. School is expensive. Apparently none of that matters, and they will continue to charge me $180 for absolutely nothing every single month. When I requested they take my credit card off file while I figure this out, they refused unless I replaced it with another card. You cannot keep my credit card information stored in your system if I do not give you permission. Doesn’t seem like they care at all about people, they’d just rather get paid. When I attempted to reach the manager of the gym I was previously attending, I was given the runaround with people claiming he would call me back later that day. He didn’t, so I called, and they said he was never there in the first place. Then the employee tried to tell me the “buyout” option was about $200 more than what I owed by just paying the full contract. Long rant, but merited. If you don’t believe me, try googling some of this (like “canceling la fitness policy”). You’ll find endless people ranting about the same topics I am. My friend has a physical disability and even then was not allowed to cancel his contract. I don’t like being rude or giving terrible ratings to companies online, because I know the companies and the individuals I’ve dealt with don’t necessarily represent every person working for the company. There’s always good people in the mix. But my anger right now cancels out any of that hesitation. Hopefully they actually take what I say into consideration."
137,3454822,2018-03-21,1,"I recently tried to purchase a gift card on the LA Fitness website. After inputting all of my information I clicked submit and it generated a response telling me it could not process my request at this time. I thought no big deal, when I leave work today I will just stop on my way home and grab one because it is so close to my home. Looked at my bank account and they took the $200. Called up to the specific location and I was told I had to call corporate. Called corporate, they aren't open until Monday. Fine. Waited until Monday, was then told by Jason that it was an internal affairs issue and I HAD TO EMAIL THEM. Now at this point I am beyond irate. This is a birthday present for my boyfriend and his birthday is 10 days away. I email ""internal affairs"" and waited 2 hours for no response. Finally I called and spoke with the GM of this certain location. He was extremely nice, tried everything he could think of to help me but with no resolution. In fact I was told this has never happened before and apparently my money is lost in space!!! RIGHT!!! Now after all this nonsense and not resolving my issue, I call back up to the store and tell them I am still willing to get memberships there but I'd just rather pay a yearly fee than have them have any of my personal bank account information due to what I just experienced. I was told I have to have a credit card on file and there is no way around it. 2 days later I have still have yet to receive a response from ""internal affairs"" and the lack of concern about not only my money and time, but the fact that my boyfriend's birthday present is lost in space, they only seemed to care about selling me into a package without any resolution to what happened to my money. Maybe a gift card of $200 since I proved to you the money posted out of my bank account and went to LA Fitness. Or I don't know a response from someone with an answer as to what is going on. Nope I will never sign up at an LA Fitness. If they will do this to someone who is trying to do everything to get into their gym, and they can't even respond, I will take my business somewhere else."
138,3451963,2018-03-20,1,I bought LA Fitness membership through an email special offer in December 2017 and once try to go over there but the guy would not let me in as I did not download their app on my phone. I was told that they are paperless company and don't even issue membership cards anymore. After a year without having used the club I tried to cancel it. The website tells you to print the form and mail it. I did that but kept on getting billed to my AMEX on record. Later I went to the club and was told that there is no manager in the club so I have to mail the printed form I had already mailed. So I mailed it again in December 2017.
139,3447961,2018-03-19,1,"I signed my husband up for LA Fitness Leesburg linked to my account. He decided to never use it. Never went there to add his signature or to take the picture. So instead of canceling him, I tried to switch his name for my mother's. You would think they would rather have a client instead of a cancellation, right? But no! They tried to charge me more $80.00 for it! I guess that's how they really make money... The year fees and the two month's prior pay! It's a business that don't really care about the customers. I ended up canceling everything, including my membership. Was advised by a previous client to cancel my credit card as well and request a new one. It seems they usually keep charging you after the cancellation. Be careful with them."
140,3442984,2018-03-17,1,"I cancelled my membership with LA fitness. They continue to charge my credit card. I put a stop on my credit card. Now I am getting calls 2-4 times a day, Saturday at 9am from people all over the country trying to get me to pay my membership. Do not ever give LA fitness your credit card. Or they will just keep charging it!!!"
141,3426085,2018-03-13,1,"I have had a membership with LA Fitness in the metro, and greater Atlanta, GA. for twenty years and I have referred well over 50 plus people, here and around the country, that also became members to this fitness center chain. Understandably this Club Chain has made $$$ thousands of dollars off of me and my referrals, and in spite of the fact that most of the clubs are not kept clean and equipment occasionally is not in function we still supported the chain with our dollars and our attendance. However, within the past 10 years I along with some of my other workout partners have experienced harassment at the hands of the staff, trainers and managers of various chains and we've been flagged as training, or should we say assisting, coaching and helping each other thru our workouts... Please correct me if I am wrong but I thought that a fitness center is a place where people that want to improve their health and fitness work out together and lend a helping hand to assist each other in their fit body pursuits. The 'origin' of my harassment stems from my profile information. When I joined LA Fitness in 2000 I was an active fitness trainer with BodiGlyphiX, Inc. and had openly put that down under the 'employment' section of my membership application. Now this factor had No Issues until LA Fitness contracted their fitness training services thru an outside company around 2000. It was well known for hiring incompetent and sometimes uncertified trainers to somehow 'guide' their members. This also led to trainers there to look at those members who had more knowledge, and for this matter 'better looking bodies' to be seen as the LA Fitness competitors to their business. Now that we've gone into the history let's look at where we stand as members. I've looked thoroughly at the membership agreement that I and other members have signed and there is NOWHERE on that agreement that has that Members can not help out fellow members, that they Workout with to achieve their fitness and health goals... The contract that I filled out doesn't say anything concerning how many people you can work out with, at what location or even how many locations (and even how many times per day) a person can exercise per day... These constitutes that the staff is 'Harassing' members and that Revoking a member's membership is illegal."
142,3422479,2018-03-11,1,Buyer beware of the fitness monthly membership charges. We were told a 6-month contract and they signed us up for a 12-month contract. My fiance is deaf. I talked to Mike and he assured me it would be no problem to cancel. 6 months later it's $500 to cancel. No exceptions by everywhere. They are a scam operation only wanting monthly payments. Don't care about the customer. Took me three weeks just to get a callback. Calling every day for 3 weeks. Very very unprofessional.
143,3421621,2018-03-11,1,"Be aware. Be very aware. I was offered a phony 2 month program because I told them I couldn't afford a year of training. I was told this isn't something we normally do. I was inadvertently tricked into signing for a year. I didn't realize it because I trusted them. In good faith, they refused to fix it because I signed the contract. The trainer who signed me up said he would never offer a 2 month program. I was shocked that he denied that they offered me a special 2 month, 10 session agreement because I trusted him. Be careful when you sign up for personal training. They get a commission for signing you up for personal training. Read the entire contract before confirming it. I finally got hold of a Corporate Officer in California. She re-negotiated the terms of the contract, but I don't think I want to go back to that gym. I'm sure Karma and God will take care of them."
144,3417397,2018-03-09,1,Anyone who has an LA Fitness Membership be warned. They are running a personal training scam and will try to get you to pay month to month. But they actually are signing you up for a year. @LAFitness #LAFitnessLifestyle CORPORATE DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.
145,3391939,2018-03-03,1,"My boyfriend has been a loyal member of LA Fitness off and on for the past 10 years. He loved playing basketball, lifting weights, bringing friends to work out with him. He never had anything bad to say about the gym. So, being a former member of LA Fitness, I didn't hesitate to sign up again with him. They even offered me a reduced rate each month, ($5 less), if I added on to his membership. Signing the contract was a breeze, not much was explained, the representative shook our hands and walked away with the commission from the sale. I visited the gym with my boyfriend twice, then stopped going. I moved out of town and the nearest LA Fitness was about 20 minutes away. My University's Recreation and Wellness center was closer, so I visited that gym more often. At that point, my membership was not being used, so I called to cancel about a month after I signed up. I spoke to a representative over the phone to cancel my membership, and at the end of the call, I was left with the impression that my membership was cancelled. In the meantime, I'd received a new card in the mail that was different than the card they had on file. Since I'd paid my last month's dues upfront, I believed that all was settled, and I didn't have to provide any information to them, being that my membership had been cancelled.Fast forward three months. I get three calls within the hour asking me to update my card on file. I dismissed the first two as a mistake, and answered the third. They demanded that I update my card immediately. I told her not to waste her time, my membership was cancelled, and to take my number off of the account because I didn't authorize them to contact me by phone. She said, word for word, ""I'll take your phone number off of the account when you update your card on file."" I laughed, hung up, and blocked the number they were calling me on, because I'm not going to allow some scorned call center rep to get snarky with me.Months later, we are reviewing our statements and realized that they did not cancel my membership, and took the liberty of using my boyfriend's card info to pay for both of our accounts without our permission, and while continuing to harass me with phone calls and emails. We immediately contacted LA Fitness, probably reached the same employee who literally yelled at us on the phone about the contract, and how we should have read the contract and do we have the contract in hand, yadda yadda yadda. We were just trying to get refunded, because we believed it was a mistake. Turns out, if you sign on a member and they don't pay (for whatever reason, regardless of whether they're using the account or not, or cancelled the account in my case), they'll go into the primary account holder's account and use their card to pay your membership dues. That's right. They will take money from an entirely separate account and apply it to your membership dues if you indicate any sort of affiliation with them. They also accused me of visiting more often than I did (12 times! I only visited twice!). We had one situation where my old membership tag was on my keys, and when my boyfriend borrowed my car, he scanned that tag. They tried to pass it off as me using the membership after I indicated that I wanted my account cancelled and tried to use that to justify not offering a refund. We told them to check their cameras and look into offering vision insurance for their employees, as my boyfriend lacks distinctive female characteristics and does not go by Natalia.They said they do not do refunds. If you call them and they say this, please use this post as a reference. They do refunds. I received a refund from LA Fitness. It is not impossible. You just have to annoy them on the phone long enough for them to do so. Which is what we did. We contacted them multiple times a day, every day, until we received our refund, (which in my book is karma for the harassing phone calls I was receiving). In retrospect, the refund we received does not even begin to cover the amount of money they took from us, but we were ready to wipe our hands clean of this grimy business and their deceptive membership tactics.Another note, and I'm sure they'll love me for this, YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP OVER THE PHONE! Again, it's just a matter of staying on the phone long enough. They'll do anything to upset you and have you hang up on them. But if you stay persistent, and complain long enough, and call them multiple times a day, they will cancel your memberships immediately.So, to recap. Don't do an add on membership unless you're willing to pay for two (or more) memberships, review your statements regularly, LA Fitness can process refunds over the phone, and you can call and cancel your LA Fitness memberships over the phone as well. Almost forgot, for those of you calling LA Fitness in a similar situation, they said the only way they would refund my boyfriend is if I paid my account balance. So either way, they would still have their money. We absolutely did not accept this offer. We had LA Fitness refund our money back without me having to pay an account balance, (since it was on them to cancel my membership). So don't let them talk you into that. Hope this helps!"
146,3370159,2018-02-26,2,"I had a horrible experience at LA Fitness recently being accused of constantly leaving weights on machines, which is a complete LIE! The district manager who was working out with these liars asked for my barcode and I refused because I knew these guys he deals with are jerks! Not too long ago one of their machines malfunctioned while I was squatting 500 lbs. and I had to get from underneath the machine quickly because I could have been seriously hurt. The manager response was everybody signs a liability waiver so it's not our fault. He was effectively saying it's not their job to ensure their machine are always working properly before members use them. This is what he is saying is the LA Fitness way! So word to the wise if you use any machines with significant weight that you use at LA Fitness I'd check it myself first before using because they really don't give a damn if you get seriously hurt or not. As a district manager you are supposed to be impartial in gym complaints, but this guy was clearly one sided because there's no way his buddies would ever lie, right? Wrong. Those guys are jerks and complete liars and there's no evidence to the contrary to say I've done this except words from liars. I will be complaining to the corporate office."
147,3360226,2018-02-22,1,"Manager and front desk were quite unprofessional. To preface this. I had a guest from out of the country visiting and she was excited to see what a good well-kept gym experience was like. She has no state ID and only her passport. Her visit would last about 9 days since she was visiting for the week. She had been to the US before and I took her to an LA fitness once and paid the $15.00 day fee. She enjoyed her time and later the representative said if she was going to stay longer in order to not pay the $15.00 fee she can sign up for a 2 week trial. It is now a couple months later at the gym in Sunset Place Miami. Early Monday morning ~7:40 am I request a trial membership for her. They say she can work out and fill the paperwork later. Excellent! I tell myself, and we enjoyed a good workout together. At the end of the workout they mentioned that since she has no state ID they can’t issue her a trial. Ok..., but they also didn’t charge us. Later that week we had been able to get in; I explained that she was only visiting for a week and I was not trying to sneak her inside at any point. (There are several exits and one main entrance; she always came through the main entrance). So, the weekend comes around and they made her pay on Saturday. I was a bit confused, but ok fine I paid for her on Saturday. Which btw was taken care of quickly and right in the front the moment she walked in. Later that day the individual in the front asked me how much longer she would be staying. I said tomorrow is her last day. Since we had been going daily to the gym. He says “OK’ and moves on.After he asked me how much longer she would be staying, both my friend and I got the impression that she could come in tomorrow morning with no extra cost. It was all verbal and nothing was written down. As I walk in I show my barcode on my keys and she is right beside me. I say something to effect of “We ok?” And he says “Ok”; again I am walking her right through the front door. Nevertheless, about 15 minutes later during our stretches the individual and his manager come to me accusing me of sneaking her inside and that I am required to pay or there will be consequences... This is 2018, and I pay my gym dues and here these two individuals are resembling what I can only call ‘thuggery’ behaviour and I tell them I am not looking for trouble, I even apologized (although I really shouldn’t have, but reflecting back upon it was marked by fear upon myself) and that I can pay her dues.Mind you, this is embarrassing despite the gym being fairly empty. It was still super unprofessional, and I really hope they don’t solve all their problems by confrontation. Regardless, I still need to pay her dues and as I am talking to them giving my credit info. They are completely asinine and have the audacity to explain to me that the statement yesterday was misinterpreted stating that they meant I could pay for 2 days and she can stay here a week. When none of that was actually spoken. All in all, today was my longest conversation with any LA fitness employee as they usually leave us alone and just do their required work which I’m usually appreciative for.I’m no saint. But the manner in which they approached me... The way they handled such a minor $15.00 transaction... The simple fact that they took the moral high ground and accused me of doing ill-begotten behaviour just didn’t sit right with me. Of course, I had to pay, but all of this could have been more tactfully resolved and considering I am a paying customer they should be more polite and professional about their business. The individual in question - Erin & his supervisor is Kevin **."
148,3337471,2018-02-16,1,"LA Fitness Columbus, OH, Polaris - I signed up for personal training under the impression I pay 160 dollars total, including monthly membership. I found out later I still owe membership fees as well. As soon as I found out I went to management, told them I couldn't afford 210 a month for gym. I wanted to cancel the contract since I was misled thinking my fee was 160 dollars. I also wanted reimbursed for the 160 dollars plus the 100 dollars I paid for training I didn't receive. I was told it was cancelled, needed to wait for phone call, they would reimburse me. I never received a phone call. Kept calling LA Fitness daily, didn't get a phone call. Management kept telling me I had to wait for this particular person to call me. He kept avoiding my calls. This has been going on since Jan. The guy would not return my calls, but took out another 160 dollars from my account. Finally I went in. Waited over an hour. Management had him call gym, on speaker phone he told me I knew what was in the contract and I wasn't getting my money back. I would either continue my training or pay the balance on my contract. Like I would even want to train with that group now. Then he said he was the boss and there was no one else I could talk to, while the other person in the room was laughing at what was said to me.Felt totally helpless no one would help. I called, stopped by almost daily, but no one could help me but the one person who wouldn't return calls. Don't ever sign up for personal training there. The head trainer is rude, and condescending. He will just take your money. You can forget about getting any return phone calls if you have a problem, or if you wanted to cancel training. Don't believe anything they tell you."
149,3296044,2018-02-04,1,"I was so happy before attending LA fitness and make membership with you all, but unfortunately I got treated badly, first of all the guy who sit with us to create our membership told us we can have our money back within a week including the enrollment fees if we change our mind, second they never mentioned that the private trainers has to be different enrollment fees (they should mention that) so we changed our mind after 5 days but we been told that it’s only 3 days from the enrollment day to get our money back and now we cannot, so I think it’s rip-off business when they lie to customers and after paid almost $300 I lose it in less than a week."
150,3289642,2018-02-01,1,"Today morning, I was at the gym and working out. I went to grab for a kettlebell to use for 5 minutes as I do commonly. The kettlebell was staying in the rack of the personal training area and nobody was using it. The trainer 'Kingsley **' has approached to me and the first thing he said was 'leave it, you cant use it', which can be okay even though it was definitely not a good way to approach a client at gym. Normal people usually starts with ‘hi’ or ‘excuse me’ Then I said I will use it for 5 min and leave it back, and I said I always do it and nobody has ever said anything, and I am not the only one who is using the kettlebells. He literally yelled at me 'MAN I SAID LEAVE IT, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT', I told him to control his voice and I said I used it before and I want to use it again if his client will not use. He shouted me again 'GET OUT OF THAT AREA, YOU ARE DISRUPTING MY TRAINING WITH MY CLIENT,' and I repeatedly warned him about keeping his voice down! Which he continued to yell at me.I am a physician, and I am very good at controlling my temper and keep myself calm because we sometimes deal with patients who has low intellectual level or has temper problems. And we learn how to talk with them. So I did not even replied to him and went to report the issue to the manager of the gym, I do not remember his name but I talked with the Personal Trainer Director. I have been a member of LA Fitness for 3 years, and was going to Natick location for 7 months without any problem. I am trying really hard to not say anything offending regarding Kingsley **, but he definitely does not deserve to work in any gym. As a summary, I was at the gym at morning after a 16 hour night shift at hospital, and I got yelled at by a tempered staff member who knows nothing about ethics or how to talk with a person."
151,3287320,2018-02-01,1,"I have been a member of LA Fitness for 3 years and very dissatisfied with how the management treated me and how my complaint was handled. Recently the staff there in East Brunswick cut my lock and without notice discarded all of my items. I understand the policy that items will be removed but discarded without allowing me to claim my items within a day? I spoke to the management there and they weren't polite quoting policy and were not even interested in my explanation. This has costed me over $200 in lost items. Perhaps if I didn’t claim my items then I understand discarding them but I didn’t even get an apology from your management and was there the very next day. I am at this club twice daily and the facility is overcrowded so I leave my items there so I can have a locker when I return the same day, not overnight. Perhaps a little gratitude for my loyalty means nothing to LA Fitness. Maybe because you are not interested in what one individuals means to your big business. I will be taking my business elsewhere."
152,3262660,2018-01-25,1,"Cancelling my membership after being a long time LA Fitness member and not looking back. LA Fitness does not give a crap about their customers!! Crazy Power Circuit instructor puts signs on the door saying not to go in during class but not supposed to if members just go get what they need quietly without bothering nobody. Then holds her stupid signs while going through the stairs screaming at me plus while I am stretching and members look at her how can she be so rude to a customer plus say they have seen her acting that way in the past. Called corporate, did not do anything. Second time, she threatens to report me and screams at me causing a whole scene in lobby. Called corporate again, no answer for 2 weeks and finally get a hold of the aerobatic director who says she will do something. 2 weeks power circuit instructor is back like nothing happened and does not apologizes for her behavior and nothing done to go above and beyond to fix the issue. When I inform the front office manager of not being happy with the customer service and cancelling my membership because of the humiliation, disrespect, threats plus rolls fingers calling me crazy, all she says is that she cannot stop me from cancelling my membership plus cannot force the instructor to apologize. Members from the Aspen Hill and Silver Spring club are so surprised on how LA Fitness treats their customers. What a great negative company publicity. If it was someone who was not **, they would acted on it. I will sure spend my money somewhere else and will let everybody not to go to LA Fitness!!!"
153,3203512,2018-01-07,1,"LA Fitness' membership cancelation process is archaic to say the least. You have to log in to their site, print a cancelation form, fill the form, and finally mail it to their offices in CA. WTF? The first time I did this I managed to cancel my membership without a problem. I then re-registered at the end of March 2017 and canceled again towards the end of July 2017 because I was traveling and would be away for over a year, however, LA Fitness has been charging me $35.99 for the past 5 months that I have been away."
154,3202711,2018-01-07,1,"Deplorable conditions and total disrespect by the managing staff in LA Fitness El Camino Shopping Center Oceanside, CA. I made a couple of complaints about the cleanliness or lack thereof of the facility and the harassment began most of which I ignored; because I have a high tolerance for persecution. The last straw was when on January 2nd I noticed a man walk through the female dressing area just when I was about to disrobe. Well, I thought perhaps he had taken a wrong turn; but then the same man did the same thing on January 6th just as I was again about to disrobe. I and a couple of ladies called him on it and proceeded to make a complaint to management. Management gave me excuses such as, ""He's from out of town and they could not explain the floor plan to him because he was Hispanic and could not speak English."" Well, I explained that this same man had done the exact same thing days prior and should be given a tour of the gym to ensure it NEVER happens again. I asked why they could not use the cleaning staff (Hispanic) to interpret for him and simply scoffed at. I explained that I was a female veteran with MST (Military Sexual Trauma)/PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and the consequences of men being allowed to wander into the female dressing is very DETRIMENTAL to my mental state. I was told it was an accident and basically get over it. When I continued to state my case, I was told that I was barred from the gym because I was cursing and physically threatening (a total lie). The manager went to the computer and begin what he called ""deleting my membership."" I wanted to know how he knew which member I was if the incident had not been premeditated. He threatened to have the police called on me if I did not leave the facility. I told him I would take a seat and wait for the police (which never showed up). SHAME ON YOU!"

They then told me he wasn't there, but that I could call and it was ""literally a two minute process"" over the phone. When I called, they told me that the only way I could cancel was to come to the gym. When I told them I had done so several times, they said they would email me. The email stated that the only way a membership could be cancelled was by physically mailing a form to the corporate office. There is a different answer each time I try to cancel, and it has been over a week. Can't imagine how long a physical form will take to get there, or how many times it will be lost."
156,3191455,2018-01-04,1,"Hi, My name is Raja. I have joined LA Fitness just 3 months back and trainer in LA Fitness, Frisco, TX pulled me in personal training sessions. I was impressed with his treatment and behavior and inclined to take personal training sessions. After two free sessions, he made me to sign electronically without sharing the physical copy of the contract. I clearly told him that I do commute between Maryland and Frisco and stay in Maryland for two weeks every month. I also told him that I will take personal training sessions only in Frisco center and my I opted for 2 sessions a week. So my stay in Frisco every month is for two weeks and sessions I have opted are 4 per month. But he put me on 8 sessions per month. When I have received my bill for 500USd, I immediately went to LA fitness center in Frisco and raised my concern. He said it was a mistake and he will get this rectified speaking to his operations manager. After that I fell sick with GOUT and didn't go to fitness center for a month, I got the second bill again for 400 USd (for 8 sessions), When I went to LA fitness, Frisco, the OM was saying that I have to pay for 8 sessions and contract can neither be changed not cancelled. I even wrote couple of mails to helpdesk and response was same. I clearly expressed my helplessness stating that I'm only the breadwinner of the family and father of three kids and can't bear 400 USD a month towards my training program. Until now, no one has responded back to me and helpdesk people always tells me that I have to pay. This is truly ridiculous and ** color robbery. Every goods being sold in the market has a cancellation policy. I made all my financial calculations and opted for 4 classes a month and now that they are demanding me to pay for 8 classes (400 a month). Anyone, can you please me how to get rid of this problem?"
157,3187186,2018-01-03,2,"LA Fitness Windermere, Orlando FL. In July 2017, face to face in the venue, I asked for the account for my wife and I to be frozen as we would be traveling. When I checked my bank statement, they had only frozen 50% of the account so were still charging full amount for my wife. When we returned I pointed this out and they said they would make a note on the account, and next time I was in during business hours it would be rectified. ""Don't worry sir it will be no problem."" My wife called them during working hours but got an ansaphone message and left a message with the same detail and could someone call her back - no-one ever did. I never placed any urgency on the matter having been reassured it would be sorted out and rectified once I popped in during working hours. I didn't get around to ""popping in during working hours"" until the 2nd January 2018 due to business commitments and injuries. Their immediate reaction was defensive and ""That is was no way we can refund. You've left it too late"".Naturally I was very unhappy so they offered two months only. Despite me pointing out it was THEIR mistake, and also that I had been reassured it would be sorted once I popped in during business hours, I was given a catalogue of reasons why it wouldn't happen: ""Anyone could say that sir"", ""It's your word against ours"", ""If you've not come in until now then obviously the money doesn't matter to you so why are you arguing"" (I am serious), ""Why did you leave it so long - you're making this up as you go along and your story keeps changing"", ""What date did you come in?"" (When I couldn't remember the exact date they said ""Well if you can't remember the date why should we believe you - you could be telling us anything"" (I am not kidding).No, my story NEVER changed. I FROZE my account in July. You failed to freeze (half of) it. The dates we left and the dates we did (try to) return, are on your computer. There is no reason to change my story. It's very, very simple. When I asked you please to rectify your mistake and action a refund accordingly you called me liar. You said I didn't deserve a refund for leaving it so long. I wasn't aware there was a timeframe and outside of that you turn into a liar? I wasn't fussed about the timeframe knowing full well it would have been sorted, as per their verbal promise.I seriously expected a quick refund (we are talking somewhere between $70 and $100), an apology (not necessary although that would have been good manners), and off we go continuing to give them $1,000 per year and be advocates (who hardly ever use the place) forever more. But no they prefer to call their customers liars and gang up on them - at one point the manager was surrounded by three muscle heads telling me I should check my accounts more often, I had too much money why should I worry etc etc. Seriously I have never been so insulted in public in my life. This would have been a breeze to resolve by saying ""Let me look into sir, I apologize for any inconvenience, and let's try and get this resolved"".I would love a staff member of LA Fitness to expose their policies as their standard lines kept pouring out and I am quite certain my experience is not a one-off. As a result of being publicly called a liar and humiliated by several members of their staff I cancelled my membership with immediate effect and will never be returning. I am sorry LA Fitness the attitude of your staff stinks and you now have one ex-customer who will make absolutely sure that anyone he comes into contact with will never go anywhere near any of your venues or your thieving policies and retracted actions and promises. By the way if anyone reads this just watch for any replies from LA Fitness. My guess is that they will refuse to respond - although I guess they could have another opportunity to call me a liar to an even bigger audience. You have been warned. Smiles on the way in, but this is a commercial monster who doesn't care in the slightest about its customers."
158,3185527,2018-01-02,1,"Let me start by saying the gym itself is awesome, yoga classes are amazing, the other classes are great, and the personal trainer I had was phenomenal. But, the personal training is extremely over-priced and the contracts are LENGTHY and there are certain locations that even if your regular trainer meets you there they charge additional fees to be trained?!? Furthermore, unfortunately I sustained a neck injury (Not at the gym) and was placed on strict physical restrictions and might need surgery. It was very challenging to cancel the training contract and it took multiple phone calls and emails to different people all the way up to the corporate office and in the meantime training sessions still accrued that I could never use. I have not been able to use my membership in months and will not be able to for months. They will not let me cancel it, transfer it to my HUSBAND, or freeze it to lengthen it. As a nurse, I have never seen an organization that had such little care for the well-being of its paying members- and even worse- it's an organization focused on health!!! I would NEVER recommend LA fitness to anyone, EVER!"

161,3104843,2017-12-07,1,"I worked out a full year with LA Fitness, and I did have personal trainings. Actually all clubs are making lots of money from members who have personal trainings. I understand that and I had a nice times with my trainers in LA Fitness, even though both of them left and told me they would find a better place than LA Fitness to work. However, I gave 1 star and decided not to work with LA Fitness ever again, not because of the trainers, not because of the facilities, I gave 1 star because of the poor membership services and 2,000 dollars I lost here. Here is what happened to me. My membership expired this July and I still have about 10 training sessions left. I came to the local club (13244 Aurora Ave N, Seattle, WA 98133) and get another 3 months membership. Because my favorite trainer left, I told the manager not to add any more sessions to me until I restarted my trainings. The manager told me not to worry about that and he will schedule an appointment for me with another manager to discuss about the personal training.I came back at the scheduled the other day after almost 1 hour drive, but he again told me the manager has been back home... He asked me to dial in on weekdays to discuss. I dialed in on the next Monday, a guy picked up my phone and told me he would have his manager to call me back in 10 minutes... And not surprised, I didn't get any phone call later on that day. I came back to the club that weekends. A front desk service guy asked me about my situation and told me that I won't be charged if I don't restart personal trainings. I believed him and just left. For the next months, I was out of US and busy with work a lot. Not until 4 months later I found that almost 2000 dollars were charged to one of my credit cards for new personal training sessions. I came back to the local club asking why that happened even after I confirmed with the manager, and they told me there is nothing they can do about that. They can only cancel all my sessions without giving a single dollar back to me. I would say LA Fitness do everything they can to charge you and put budget on you. Their local club services are disrespectful. Again, a terrible experience with LA Fitness. I will never recommend any of my friends going to this club."
162,3090863,2017-12-04,1,"Please save yourself the time and money and DO NOT sign up for personal training. To save face I won't name names but they put on this persona that they are really in it to help you and further your goals but really when the time comes for renewals, cancellations, etc. they clearly don't care about you other than squeezing all they can out of you and getting in their numbers. It's a horrible game preying on the vulnerable. I was so excited and had high hopes for personal training at LA fitness but could not have been more disappointed with my experience. There are so many other superior options not to mention more affordable - please don't fall into this awful trap!"
163,3059851,2017-11-23,1,Worst experience ever. Tried to get a guest pass for my brother because we were thinking of getting him a membership and it was the hardest thing to do and didn’t even get a guest pass. Then when I tried talking to a manager they gave me the hardest time with that too. It’s like they didn’t wanna help me at all. Worst experience ever. Going to cancel my membership and switch gyms.
164,3032407,2017-11-15,3,"I signed up a 1 year personal trainer contract. My first training (after several years no sport) ended with me not able to walk for 2 weeks due to strain and heavy sore. No advice of stretching before and after... After 10 month I did let them know I don't want to extend my membership. From this moment I was not greeted anymore from the staff where they check the membership card when you enter (not from the trainers). The best part is - I don't have online access anymore to book my trainings even if I'm still a paying customer since my account has now the ""cancel"" status. It's just insane how people at this firm treat customer when they know they don't get any more money. Maybe they should hire capable IT people. We are living in the 21st century... and I know this is manageable. Since I read the reviews here I'm curious if they try to charge my card in the future... I would not wonder."
165,3023584,2017-11-11,1,"LA Fitness Hilltop, Kingstowne Alexandria, VA - Well here we go again. I reported this issue to the Fairfax County authorities because it is a public health concern. November 11 NO HOT WATER in the lavatory or showers. It has been that way for ""several days"" according to the staff. I reported this last year about the same time, when temperatures dropped below freezing. You think maybe the staff did NOTHING to prevent water pipes freezing? Or perhaps it is the utility room constantly alarming (continuous beeping) that I hear almost every time I visit this gym. Oh, and to add insult to injury, the constantly playing audio loop in the club tells us to ""check out our juice bar for a refreshing smoothie""... Well, there is NO JUICE BAR. Are these clowns asleep at the wheel or what?"
166,3021580,2017-11-10,2,"I have been a member since early '17. I have only kept the membership because of convenience sake. The equipment, including the air conditioner (this is in South Florida where it's a zillion degrees in the summer) are often broken. There was a smash and grab last week in the parking lot where multiple cars were broken into and had items stolen and they couldn't even be bothered to clean the glass up in the parking lot (days later it was still everywhere). It's a rarity if there are paper towels in any of the dispensers and often no sanitizer. Most of the staff have a nonchalant attitude and barely speak when you enter or leave the gym. Equipment, from what I have heard and believe it because I see it, is the original from when the gym opened. A lot of the cardio machines are rusty and need to be calibrated or ""set""... The plates on the ellipticals and CrossFit trainers are uneven - making for sore knees every workout... Sorry not much good to say here, unfortunately. A few nice employees - that's about it... Hands down it's the worst gym I've ever worked out at but again, it's in a semi-safe location and the closest other gym in a nicer area is a 20-25 min drive."
167,3021364,2017-11-10,1,"If you're just looking for a gym to work out at (you have your own routine, know what you want to do, etc.), then this place isn't too bad - aside from the fact that they make the cancellation process unnecessarily difficult for working professionals and that they seem to take forever to replace broken equipment. Now the Personal Training (a.k.a. Pro Results) is a whole other story... When you first join the gym, you're offered a complimentary fitness assessment. They market this as a way to help you set your workout goals upon joining the gym so that you can better tailor your personal workout to your needs, but it's really just to get you to purchase their absurdly priced Personal Training packages. They are extremely deceptive in their practices, and will have you thinking that you're paying $45 - $50 per session on a monthly basis to be whipped into shape by a fitness expert via 1 hour sessions.The fitness assessment is usually done by the head trainer, and meant to be grueling on purpose to give you the illusion that those are the kinds of workouts you'll be receiving, as well as make sure you're too tired to really read between the lines of their nonsense. They'll also talk a big game about ""measuring you, weighing you, and giving you customized meal plans/nutrition tips"" to get you to your goals faster. My favorite part is the nonsense of you signing a ""month to month contract"" and that your signature is required so that your account can be debited for the payment since Pro Results is a different company, and so that you have signed off understanding the inherent risk of working out.ALL LIES! First of all, you really only get 25 minutes with the trainer. The other 25 - 30 minutes you're expected to do your own independent work... in other words, something you could've done yourself without the personal training account. Secondly, many of the trainers on the floor aren't even certified, and you don't really know their education level with regard to personal training, fitness, and nutrition. I have been using the service for 4 months and have yet to see any type of customized meal plans or have any measurements taken.After having some buyer's remorse and wanted to cancel the PT account (because it seemed like all my PT was doing was finding exercises on YouTube and asking me to do them - I can do that myself and save $130+ a month), I'm told that I signed into a year long contract, similar to a lease and that I cannot get out unless I pay a buyout fee of 50%, and that I will not be able to redeem any sessions. I explained with corporate that I was not told that this was a year long contract, I was told that this was month to month like my regular gym membership. All she had to say was... ""Well, did you read the contract?""I expressed to her that I felt their tactics were deceptive and that it's unreasonable for someone to deduct that they're locking into a year-long contract for a GYM service when hearing, ""You pay for this on a month to month basis."" This is not a loan that I applied for or a mortgage/lease. It's Personal Training services, for crying out loud (and SORRY personal training at that!).These people lack compassion. I know a girl that got furloughed from her job and wanted to freeze the contract, they wouldn't allow her to do it. She also didn't realize she couldn't cancel. People have had major life events and changes, relocated, and no matter what, have been unable to cancel. Find an independent personal trainer, or a gym that won't trick you into signing an outrageously high year-long contract for 30 minutes each week with a personal trainer that might've never worked out a day in their life, but went through an internal LA Fitness training development program and now is on the floor all of a sudden as an ""expert."" LA Fitness is horrible!"

TOO LATE. I’m contacting a lawyer and suing this company. They will pay dearly in court costs and damages.

I went into LA Fitness to cancel and was told I had to mail the form. I told them that in an email, I was told it would be quicker to go in person to cancel. Then they changed their story, and said I would have to come back between 9-5 because only one person was authorized to cancel the membership and they weren't there. I explained to them I work from 8-5 and couldn't come in between those hours. What a deceptive practice to make it SO hard to cancel a month-to-month membership. Shame on LA Fitness."

They will not offer month to month for personal training which so many other gyms do. Shop around, find a gym that gives you easy month to month sign up, no penalty cancellations, deferment of sessions if you have to take a break and will not charge you initiation fees or sign up fees which are ridiculous! 24 hour fitness is a much better option.

What they do not tell you is that if you move and want to cancel, they will drag it out and try to take as much money from you as possible. You hear one thing from the club and then another thing from billing. So after you talk to your former personal trainer, and think the matter is resolved you get charged again and again. Sure the club is alright, but whatever you do, do not sign for a personal trainer."

Not only is this completely absurd, but this should not be legal for a company to require a member to pay a fee despite medical restrictions provided by a physician. The staff that works at the LA Fitness my husband and I attend has a very high turnover rate, which does not help when trying to refer to things that were told when you signed up several months ago.

I did ask the trainer. He said it's 30 minutes. I told him Joe said 45 minutes. He shakes his head and didn't say anything. First 2 months everything was ok besides the 25 minutes. After 2 months and it was on Monday I had training at 6.30 in the evening. Went there and I saw the trainer name Luis training someone else. I asked him what happened. He said, ""They told me to training new member."" I said, ""But you didn't even called me and told me that you can't training me today."" Luis said, ""Talk to the manager name Joe."" Went to talk to Joe. He told me that he's short on trainers and, ""Please be patient. I have new trainer coming next week."" After 2 weeks he called me and he told me that I can do one time a week till he hire new trainer. I asked him about the missing sessions. He said. ""Don't worry. It will roll over and you won't lose anything.""Time went by and my last session was in August 19 -2017. I did ask how many session I have left. They said 33. I ask what's going to happen. Now they told me, ""You pay 35 dollars each month for 3 months and you finish your 33 sessions."" I said, ""Ok. I'll pay the 35 dollars a month."" Went on vacation and come back. I saw that LA fitness charge my account another 300 dollars. Went there and I did talk to Joe. I said, ""You charge me 300 dollars and the contract is over."" He start showing me in the contract that I was suppose to cancel it otherwise they will keep charging me. I told him, ""I told you guys to cancel the contract and we made a deal that when I'm back I will pay 35 dollars a month for 3 more months."" He start lying in my face and acting like a street person.I don't understand why LA fitness will hire that kind of peoples unless the corporate knows what are they doing. By the way I find out that I'm not the only one who's had this bad experience with LA fitness in Pasadena especially with who he call himself a manager. Joe. Call the corporate and explain what happened. They told me they have to talk to Joe first. Seems like my problem with Joe not with respectful. LA fitness I feel this manager Joe doing fraud and someone need to stop him. I'm going to take him to the court one on one since the corporate don't care and I'm not going to pay 300 dollars a month to finish the sessions. I already pay for it."

178,2887282,2017-10-02,1,"I received an email advising me my membership was up for renewal and I was required to give 60 day's notice to cancel my membership. I called to cancel but was advised that I had to come in M - F between 9 - 5. Funny, I was able to sign up any time of day, but had to come in during business hours to cancel. What if I was unable to during those times and hours, I was told I had to come in only during that time to cancel. I went in to cancel and was told I would receive an e-mail confirmation my cancellation. I had to go back in two more times to finally receive the e-mail that confirmed that I cancelled my membership. I was told that I would not have any other charges charged to my account as of August. In September I was still charged $203. I went in and was advised that they were going to get the Operations Manager to call me. Three days later and no call, I called them. I spoke to the Operations Manager, Lesha but was told that it was Dustin I needed to speak to. So again I was told by the staff the wrong person that I needed to speak to. I was on hold for about 10 minutes when he finally came to the phone. I told him what happened and he explained that he will not refund the charges for September as I did not cancel my personal training. I asked him how am I suppose to access the gym without a membership. He had no response but said because I did not speak to him personally about cancelling the personal training, it was not cancelled. He will cancel it for October. I explained to him that I was never advised that I needed to speak to him to cancel my personal training. I asked to speak to someone that could correct this situation. He said he is the only one at that location. I asked for the head office and he said you can call them but they are only front line and won't be able to do anything about it. I called the head office and the person that answered the phone said that he will ask about the matter and get back today to me. When I asked him for his name, he said it wasn't needed as he made a note about the call. I have no faith that I will get my money back for a service that I cannot access because I no longer have a membership with. I am also worried that I will get a similar charge in October again since I only have the word of someone that is does not conduct business in an ethical manner."
179,2886781,2017-10-02,1,"I signed up my 15 year old son with a personal trainer at LA Fitness. I needed for someone to coach him during workouts and get him to get the most out of his time at the gym. The staff was so friendly when we went for our free first session. So I signed up for twice a week at a whopping cost of $250 per month. Soon after my son joined the football team at school and got his ankle crushed during a play. I tried to explain to LA Fitness that he could not workout for a while and they could have cared less. They started quoting Attorney General of Georgia Law to me and said there was no way out of my contract because I had signed my life away. I called Corporate in LA and they were even bigger jerks. And the nice trainer that my son boned with and was looking forward to working with left after a month. So after he recovered we tried to squeeze in a few more training sessions in July and the new trainer he was assigned to was on vacation- but did they still charge us? OF COURSE THEY DID! Explain that one to me. Well in the fine print it says that I'm suppose to drive across town to another LA Fitness when that happens. Oh they have everything covered. These guys have top notch lawyers that write contracts that cannot be broken no matter what. So now my son is hurt again after a rough football game, and I have a doctor's note and everything saying he is not to work with a trainer at Personal Fitness and they still don't care. This is a greedy, awful company. Can't wait to dump them and never, ever go back. I hope the whole company folds and declares bankruptcy. I will celebrate!"
180,2864361,2017-09-25,1,"All they are looking is ripping off money from customers. They don't care about the customers' satisfaction. I joined LA fitness at Normal/Bloomington, IL facility. Just after 1.5 months of joining I had to move to Albany, NY all of a sudden. I went to inquire if they have a facility at Albany, NY, which they didn't. While signing up for membership, I paid for 2 months in advance and was told if some unforeseen circumstances comes (the employee specifically mentioned - such as moving to a city where there is no facility), we will refund you the last month money if the month's billing has not started. I agreed and paid for 2 months in advance. But when I had to cancel, they told me their manager is not available. I wonder why they have so many people sitting behind desk but only person who can cancel. Now reading after so many reviews, it seems almost everyone went through the same problem. I was lucky that I found the membership cancellation manager after 3 visits and he agreed to cancel my membership. But he refused to return the advance payment for last month (which was still 15 days away). I took the corporate number but when I called at that number, a lady named Michelle was talking as if she was reading the script. She kept on saying that did you read the agreement.And when I asked, “Is what you say and what you write two different things?” Then she said something magical - ""You have the ability to use the gym, but if you are unable to use it, I can't give you the refund"". And I asked her – “That is precisely I am saying. I do not have the ability to use the gym, since you have no facility in Albany, NY.” And she again repeated the same thing. So, finally I Asked her, “Where can I post customer reviews?” And her response was that “You email us your review.” And when I asked, “So, you are going to filter the review,” she has no response and kept saying email us at blah blah blah email I'd. I got really pissed off and disconnected the phone eventually. I will never recommend this gym to anyone. Cancellation is such a messy process and you will definitely end up losing money."

Loren ** was overly aggressive with her delivery with the intent of making my experience very uncomfortable among club members. Please note: LA Fitness Our best resource is the team of people who warmly greet you. The managers are dedicated to making the fitness experience an exception one. Loren ** provided just the opposite. Sincerely, Extremely Dissatisfied Member."
182,2828649,2017-09-13,1,"This locker room is never kept up. The showers have clumps of hair on the shower floors, broken tile, baby powder spilled all over the benches. The shower curtains have mold on them. For a gym that charges 30.00-40.00 per month to be a member should really look at fixing these things and have better up keep."
183,2739043,2017-08-16,2,"I know it used to be really common for gyms to have you sign a one year or two year contract and then not let you out of it when you wanted to cancel. The last couple of gyms I have been a member at, have not given me this issue, but LA Fitness did. I emailed them last month to cancel my membership and they sent me a confirmation email. Unfortunately, I didn't see that the final billing date they listed was July of next year, not this year, until I called to find out why it was still being taken out of my account. I asked them how much sense it makes for me to cancel the membership but still keep paying for it... I might as well have kept it, and they should have made it clear to me that I would still continue to be charged. They stated I could do a ""buyout"" for $105, which I will be doing since it's cheaper than paying for another full year, but I told them I was also going to make sure everyone knows to NEVER sign a contract with them!!!!"
184,2729169,2017-08-14,1,"I went in to cancel my membership at the LA Fitness desk and was not informed about the cancellation procedure nor was I given any form of receipt. The employee at the desk simply told me that everything was fine and that the membership was canceled. I found out that LA Fitness failed to cancel my membership and has been charging my credit card for one year and refuse to give me a refund. Customer services reassured me that they would look into the problem and call me back with updates. They never called back and when I called they said that they still would not refund me. Do not recommend this gym for anyone, you will get ripped off big time."
185,2729148,2017-08-14,1,"I believe there is two sides to every story. So that being said let me start with the positive. Clifton LA Fitness there was 2 class instructors that were Awesome April and Shannon. Classes were challenging and fun and they taught them well. The negative. If you like basketball forget it. Courts always packed and no one there to organize playing time. Better off going to a park. Facilities at times disguising. Machine broke for months and some looked like they were never clean, same with locker rooms. And Never I repeat Never sign up for personal trainer it's a waste of money. They promise you things at initial interview and don't deliver or follow up. I never was measured or giving a book to write down progress. And be careful when you cancel anything there. They charged me after I cancelled my son’s membership and took 2 weeks of discussion to get refund. Personal training department reminded me of a shady cars salesmen just out to make a buck and pretending to care about Fitness. And once summer hit the personal trainers were not there as often so it was hard to use up session. I could go on forever. Ending on positive note Clifton LA trainer Brandon was great. But upper management it's all BS smoke and mirrors. Read everything carefully before signing. They rush you through it. Hoping you do read it."
186,2686964,2017-07-31,1,"Recently, I brought a friend to go swimming when Will informed me in a very authoritarian, paternalistic voice that I could not bring her in without her providing him with a passport. I also said I had been told I would be paying only $5 for her visit. Will then informed me that wasn't the case - that the charge was $15. I was willing to pay this but we didn't bring in any ID except for my membership card. You would think that I could have been told in a nice voice that this time he would make an exception and let us in but going forward my friend, visiting from Switzerland, would have to bring her ID in. Oh... No flexibility there. Additionally, in the past I have asked for help with how a particular machine was operated correctly and told that I would have to do a special program at $99. Just to see how to properly use the equipment? If you can... go somewhere else! Who needs that to relax..."
187,2686115,2017-07-31,1,"Do NOT sign any type of agreements with LA fitness. I signed up for personal training and made it very clear that I only wanted a 6mo agreement. The document I signed had the exact number of sessions and a Total Cost so I thought I was fine. Nope. I noticed I had a charge on my card for two additional months and when I called LA fitness they said the agreement I signed has to be verbally cancelled or they continue to charge you. I was NEVER told this when I signed the agreement and their response is ""tough."" So I'm out almost $500 for nothing. I immediately cancelled my membership to the club and even that was not easy."
188,2677127,2017-07-27,1,"I have been a Bally/LA Fitness customer for over 30 years and I cannot recall when I have been so disappointed in overall maintenance of a gym facility. I can see from the number of complaints online that neither Louis Welch or William Horner take pride in ensuring their facilities provide a clean and healthy workout environment for their guests. I verbally complained to staff person behind the desk about my concerns which are not new but ongoing and his answer was it is an ""older"" facility which I find a totally unacceptable. This week there are 10 machines scheduled for maintenance. On an average week there are always 2 - 4 down for repair. The carpet in the workout room is filthy and I would think unhealthy for any member to lay down and touch the floor. Word was when LA Fitness took over from Ballys' they were going to make a number of improvements, replacing carpet for one, but that still has not happened. They have painted and replaced a portion of the carpeted wall borders around gym but other half is still the old peach, dirty border. Two of the TV sets are not working and a third is a green flickering screen. One TV that had black lines in the picture since LA Fitness took over location was just finally replaced. I guess it may take another three years to get other TV's working again! I wonder if the Health Department would approve the dirty floor and the unsanitary condition of bathrooms. The air conditioning continues to be an ongoing problem. I am truly surprised none of the LA Fitness staff at Encino facility have complained about their working conditions. It seems they are not permitted to have a/c on in office so the workout area is cooled. Well, it is a nice thought but does little to help the airflow in gym.I think you are lucky no one has called OSHA about the poor working conditions they must endure. Every day I hear other guests complaining about the overall condition of gym but not sure anyone has taken the time to air their grievances. My hope is that you will stop treating this location like the ugly stepsister it is and bring the facility into the 21st century or at least a facility you could be proud of having the LA Fitness name. I will keep my fingers crossed we see improvement in overall aesthetics to improve your customers workout experience."
189,2647637,2017-07-20,1,"LA Fitness makes it ridiculously easy to create and account/sign-up for membership online. However, when you want to close your account, they make so incredibly difficult (it's blatant harassment). My cc was used in fraud so cc company issued new card, and I seized the opportunity - instead of providing LA Fitness with a new cc number - to inform them I was closing my account. They took no action, rather in the span of a 2-3 days over Memorial weekend - proceeded to leave at least 6+ voicemails on my phone about how they've been unable to charge my monthly fee, and I need to call them and update payment records quickly to avoid a late fee. Upon return from holiday, I returned at least one of those call and reiterated my interest in closing my account, and advised I would sent them a check for the last month (although I believe they collect that up front when you sign-up). I literally spoke to 3-5 different people who continued to call me from LA Fitness, and advise me I had to go into the gym to request cancellation, or mail my cancellation request. Why? Didn't have to do that when I signed up! A month or so later, after repeated calls, I acquiesced and walked into the local LA Fitness gym to request my account be cancelled. I was informed the person I needed to meet with was unavailable (not even in the gym). I asked to complete the process with another manager, and was advised there was no one else who had the ability to close my account. I left a message at the front desk with my name and phone number, requesting Keiara call me back, but she didn't call me back. Two days later I call LA Fitness again, requesting to speak to seemingly the only person who has the magic power to close account, and once again she was not there. I left a message again, and finally received a callback, although she was confrontational and argumentative in her efforts to not only explain away her absence, but also the general business practices of LA Fitness to drag out the membership closure process so they can collect more money. The only reason I joined with LA Fitness is because I knew they lost a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT for exactly this type of unethical business practice, so I thought they'd cleaned up their act. They haven't, rather it seems they've found legal ways I guess to incorporate language in membership documentation that allows them to continue unethical business practices of harassing members about payment, and making one jump through ridiculous hoops to simply close an account."
190,2605392,2017-07-13,1,"This company shows ZERO appreciation/respect for clients, especially when you seek to terminate your gym membership. Don't waste your money! LA fitness will make you pay in advance even if you will not use the gym in the future! This company makes it outrageously hard to cancel, giving you only two options: mail a certified letter or go in person to one of their locations and have an operations manager cancel your membership, if you are lucky enough to find one at the location when you go. Suffice it to say, you can save yourself hundreds of dollars and your precious time by steering away from this consumer-abusive company."

One day, I saw this woman who wear a tennis shoes and walking in the pool. I told her that she shouldn't wear that shoes and walking in the pool. She told me that she bought that shoes just for pool using. I went to front desk and complained to the gym staff who was working in that facility. She told me that is pool shoes, she can use it in the swimming pool. I felt that they really don't care about how important sanitizing is in a public facility. There are kids class in that swimming pool, same time, some adult woman wear a tennis shoes walking in the pool. I told her that some people could get sick by using a polluted water. She looked at me and told me that is pool shoes. I left there and never want to go back again."
192,2580045,2017-07-05,1,"I was already a member of LA Fitness Club and moved to a different location. Hence visited the club near my new apartment to inquire about changing my membership. I was required to pay $15 more for this club than what I was paying at the old club, so I've decided to continue to go the old club although it is only 3 miles away from my new home. Then the new club manager called me on my cell and after a prolonged conversation, I've agreed to buy the annual membership with an exception of membership for me and my wife for $504 at two different clubs since my wife is about to move to a different state. He has processed my membership immediately over the phone and we were asked to take picture and collect the contract the next day. When we went to the club the next day which is a Saturday, the one who has processed my membership wasn't there and we were asked to come back the following Monday. Unfortunately, I couldn't go on Monday and was delayed by a couple of days. Finally, when I went to collect the contract and take picture, the club personnel asked to come with my wife, so they can take a picture together, which means both of us has to go the club together at the same time and to the same club. The manager named Cass who processed my membership isn't there to talk about and the staff won't reveal where their manager is. Finally, I was told that, Cass was transferred to a different location and I couldn't reach him. So, I do not have an option to cancel my membership, since they've already charged me for the whole year. Further, embarrassment followed me after a month or so. My credit card was charged for the monthly membership fee by the old club. When I've called the old club, they said I've had 2 memberships with LA Fitness at 2 different locations. Who on earth will have dual memberships to a gym? And I've had to tell them to cancel my membership on the old club since I've moved and have another membership at a different location. Also, they won't refund me the money since they consider this a one month notice. I was really pissed off with this incident and do not know whom to complain or what to do next dealing with these liars and irresponsible money machines. It took me many days to find this platform and write a review about so, I can warn others to not to fall into this trap by these so called LA Fitness gym."
193,2576739,2017-07-03,1,"I've been a member of LA Fitness for a year and a half since discontinuing my membership from another popular gym. Out of the many times I've come to this gym I've never ever had an experience like today's. I brought a guest for the first time and will never attempt to bring anyone here again! I was told that in order for her to work out she had to pay $15 for the day because my account doesn't have guest membership privileges and that was ok, I was gonna do it. The turnoff was how RUDE I was given this information by the young man at the front desk (who clearly should not have been there). He had very poor customer service skills! He acted like he was angry at something because he couldn't look me in the eye as he spoke. If I hadn't had such an excellent monthly price to go to this gym I'd discontinue my membership and go someplace else! The person who owns this gym should be ashamed of the poor customer service here. My guest was considering joining but this experience was an deal breaker because she's not! Anyone considering this facility should think again!"

They said no that all I had to do was pay an initial fee of $91.99. We asked again to check before we joined and they reassured us that the fee would stay the same. I was looking over our bank statement and noticed that LA Fitness was taking our $32.46 twice in the month. We called and were informed that that fee was for me. This is such poor representation and service. They mislead us and have had 4 months worth of charges taken out without our consent. My husband canceled my membership and my son's just now. I feel so taken by them and will make sure I let others know of their poor service and misrepresentation. My husband is still a member but we are looking into other options."
195,2562594,2017-06-28,1,"I had a really inconvenient experience in LA Fitness in Coconut Creek, FL. There is a guy working there, Ahmad **, he is a sales manager and I had two really inconvenient experiences with this guy. I decided to make some investment in my health, and I was looking for a gym, so when I was doing my registration in the LA Fitness unit mentioned, I was not so sure if my wife would participate with me in the gym. Trying to convince me, he said that I could assign my wife, paying a $150 registration fee for a family subscription, and if she decided not to come, that he would give me one week to change from family to personal subscription, giving me a refund of the balance. In the same moment, I asked about my son participating with the family as well, that he was 8 years old, and he said that my son could use everything they have in their facilities, including pools, etc. and I could bring him as guest anytime, if I decide for a personal registration. So, I did the family registration. What happens, is that my wife decided not to participate, it was the next Friday, still during the week period he gave me. When I came to the front desk to cancel her subscription, he said that it was past 3 days already and that he could not refund me anymore. I tried to remember him about the deal he offers me, but no success.Ok, I tried to forget that, and kept coming to the gym, I brought my son once after that as guest, but for my surprise, today, June 28, I brought my son to the gym as guest and this Ahmad came to me in a really rude way, saying that I should take my son out of the gym, because he was not allowed to be there. I tried again to remember him about what we dealt but no success again. He was so indelicate that I cancel my subscription as well. So, it is so sad that LA Fitness let people so unqualified represent their name... that they are just interested to take people's money, than to maintain a good reputation... sad."
196,2558895,2017-06-27,1,I signed up for a 6 month personal training package and was not satisfied after one session. I did not receive a physical copy of the contract that says I only have a 3 day window to cancel. I cancelled within 7 days and they are trying to hold me to 6 months of services that were not rendered due to dissatisfaction. I sent them by certified mail my membership cancellation and my personal training package cancellation. They continued to charge my account during the dispute process so I cancelled my credit card. They are notorious for recurring charges even after cancelling. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a gym!! BUYER BEWARE!!
197,2552181,2017-06-24,1,I called customer care as well as stop by at location. They were not willing to cancel my membership. They were just postponing my dates to charge me additional month. One of the answer I got that Manager suppose to have 3 hrs lunch. That was rude. I also used Planet Fitness before and they have very straightforward cancellation policy. That is I really like it.
198,2549955,2017-06-23,1,"I canceled my membership with LA Fitness, they took 151.62 out of my checking account without my permission. It was within the legal guidelines. They told me that I did not have to pay any dues until July and that would 25.00. Well today they took 151.62. Upon calling them, they told me it was not within the date of cancellation. So you tell me — If they tell you that you do not have to pay until July, but they still take out of the due plus more, what would you do? Never again!!! Being unemployed that money means the world to me now. The guy on the phone that I was talking was laughing!! Can you believe that? Told my bank to dispute it. If the membership is canceled they should not be allowed to take any money out of your checking without your permission. Don't care who you are, they should not be allowed!!! RIPOFF!!! Never again!!!"
199,2543247,2017-06-21,1,"I purchased the LA Fitness's personal trainer sessions for 6 month. When I join, I said specifically that I only want to buy 28 sessions for 6 months. But when I sign the contract, they have auto renewal in the agreement, I didn't read it carefully which is really my bad. But in Month 4, I hurt my back and try to cancel the program. The employee there tell me I can't cancel. I can either buy out the last two months or I can stay and use my sessions after recovery because sessions never expire. And I can also let other people use my sessions. I figured why not and decided to stay, which is a terrible terrible mistake. In Month 7, I was charged again for the sessions and I go to the gym for refund. And they tell me there is auto renewal in my agreement, and all my sessions will expire within 30 days if I cancel. And the sessions are not transferable, I can't let other people use my sessions. I told him that's not what I was informed last time but he said he doesn't care what I heard and they are not responsible for what their employees said. Then I ask for corporate number to check if there can be an exception, the operation manager wrote a number on the paper and said it's his number and he is corporate. Later I got pretty upset and started to shed tears, and the manager said, ""Oh it's probably because you were crying so they just tell you what you want to hear to get you out of the door."" In the end, he suggests me to stay in the program for my sessions to stay active... I don't want to make this personal but I just don't understand how they can be so uncaring when it comes to business. I would never ever fall for that again. The whole system is just very rigid and tricky, they try everything to make you stay and they make sure you will pay when you leave."

201,2512698,2017-06-12,1,"Back in January 2017, I called in to the West Saint Paul LA Fitness to have my account put on hold. The guy said that they call it ""Freezing"". They freeze the account for $10 a month until I am ready to start up the membership again and that is so I don't get charged the full membership fee again. When it was all said and done, he said not to worry about a thing. I'm a busy guy and I have all my credit cards paid electronically so I don't have to worry about having any late fees. It's now 6 months later and I called to have my membership un-frozen. I spoke with the Taylor (manager) who informed me that my account was never frozen. He said that It was my fault for not requesting an email receipt and that it's too bad, so sad. Taylor's attitude is not very pleasant and makes it difficult to want to continue this membership at this club."
202,2492220,2017-06-06,3,"LA Fitness is private, comfortable and adorable. I can go by myself and it is close to where I live. If I want to join a group, it’s there if I want it. Also, I like the price and payment options. It’s not expensive and I like their privacy policies and their polite staff. It’s quiet but I wish they had a refreshment bar and their hours were better for me."
203,2492442,2017-06-06,5,"I had a choice of three different gyms. I had an LA fitness, ATC Fitness and a 24 Hour but I've never heard any complaints about LA fitness so that is the one I went with and I can honestly say I'm completely satisfied with this gym. What I like most is the variety of the equipment. You will be able to exercise any muscle in your body without having to really find alternate workouts for different types of body parts. It is very convenient. However, I didn't like the planning it took to find the time to go because it is an honest scheduled event because it's hard to find an hour in most of my days because I'm so busy."
204,2492490,2017-06-06,5,The gym is my favorite one and I go there about 4 times a week. I love how they treat the people who come into their gym. They have great employees helping out the gym members any way they can and they have trainers. They also have a lot and the biggest selection of workout equipment and are always putting in new equipment. Everything about the gym is awesome and it meets my expectations.
205,2492241,2017-06-06,5,"LA Fitness has great service and helpful staff. I enjoy their gym because it has many different machines and classes for me to take. I also like using their weights and equipment. Most of my friends also have memberships and we all workout together. Additionally, I prefer this gym because it's open twenty four hours a day so I can pick what times I could workout and they also allow me to plan my workout accordingly. This give me more freedom than other gyms. However, I dislike that some of their gyms don't have enough parking for me. At time their gym could be a little busy so I have to wait for my turn on different machines. I don't like how I have to rent a locker either. I think that they should include lockers with their membership."
206,2492550,2017-06-06,4,"I enjoy the fact that there are places where you can go and exercise, enjoy the usage of equipment, meet lots of neat people and all the while be doing a great thing for your life and your body. Lots of exercise equipment meaning you do not have to stand in long lines to wait on the usage of the machines. I also enjoyed the variety of the different types of equipment to work on certain areas of the body. I felt great that it was enough to do at the gym and it held my interest. LA Fitness offers classes as well and the instructors are very encouraging and professional enough to assist me, answer questions, as well as help me in discussions about problem body areas. The instructors are knowledgeable and the staff is great. The people working there enjoys what they do and it shows in their attentiveness and courteousness. I enjoyed the fact that I was allowed the opportunity to work at a beginner's pace until I was comfortable to increase my pace. However, it would be nice if they can extend times to open earlier and close later, add Yoga classes so members can practice meditation and have a walk-a-thon to support a charity in the sponsorship of the center. Other than these, the gym has met my expectations. I received a membership in the past as a gift and I enjoyed it."
207,2492295,2017-06-06,4,I chose LA fitness because I got a free month membership a while ago. I went to their gyms to test it out and I really liked working out there so from there on I continued to use LA Fitness. I really like most of the features that LA fitness provides to us members. Some of my favorite features is that you get a personal trainer that helps you achieve your fitness goals. You can give a VIP guest pass to a friend and or family member. They also have racquetball courts so that you can play with your friends and have fun. I have a great time working out at their fitness gyms but more can be added in their features for members that will make it more fun and motivating to work out there.
208,2492346,2017-06-06,5,"I liked the cleanliness of the gym and the attentiveness of the training staff. Spacious workout area allowing for less chance of accidents. Even though it is spacious nothing is taken away from the availability of the trainer being available when you need help. But I would offer better discounts, better incentives for newcomers to be motivated to continue their workouts. Also to upgrade the referral plan for existing members. Give incentive to regulars to promote through word of mouth what has gotten them eye catching. But overall this gym had more personality. You get a feeling or sense of being a part of something greater the moment you step in the door. This feeling breaks down the walls of embarrassment and self-doubt, grasp onto the tools given to them, and rip out a new body only meant for the determined and privileged."
209,2492394,2017-06-06,5,"It is my 'mommy time' so I love just about everything at LA fitness!! From the track to the machines, tanning, cardio and classes, it has everything I look for in a gym and not just free weights. It's a lot of fun! I appreciate that it's expensive so they don't allow just anyone in there and happily, I don't have to worry about the clientele and I feel safe walking to my truck. But it could be a little cleaner, spotless and germ free in my opinion! There could be antibacterial wipes at each station. I skeeve other people's sweat on a machine that I'm about to get on so I bring my own wipes."
210,2492436,2017-06-05,4,"LA Fitness is a nationwide chain. They have good reputations and better online reviews. I had previous good experience and a friend also recommended it to me and we go together to keep each other company and keep each other from missing classes. It has a variety of exercise programs to choose from and they have trainers that are knowledgeable. It's inexpensive and conveniently located. However, I would like to see Barre or Zumba classes available as well because those activities are fun and on trend. I would also like to have an option of a professional trainer creating an exercise schedule from fitness classes available, like yoga, pilates and such to accommodate my needs."
211,2492484,2017-06-05,5,"When I was looking for a good gym to join, I narrowed my search to class availability and monthly rate and LA fitness was the best deal out of all of them. I've been in the best shape of my life and I thank them for giving me the opportunity. The gym has all of the modern day amenities that I need to get in great shape. They also have very personable trainers that help out whenever you need and the people that go there are very friendly. The experience is great and comforting as is but I wish they would find a way to reduce the lines on certain equipment in peak hours."
212,2492235,2017-06-05,3,"My family agreed on a family plan at LA Fitness. It has a lot of different locations and it's fairly large and has decent hours. It was much cheaper and it was more convenient at the time. The class instructors are well trained and they usually give a great workout session. And then the gym classes usually aren't too crowded and the facility is clean. I can also get a great workout in the pool. However, the gym isn't near my current workplace that is why I chose another gym. It was also too crowded and I don't like to wait on cardiovascular machines in a gym. I like to get in, get a workout and leave."
213,2492286,2017-06-05,3,"I chose this gym because it's close to home and I can walk or jog there. All of my friends goes there. We workout together and play basketball with each other. The basketball court, the pool and the people there is very nice. My workout partner is cool too. I always work hard at the gym no matter what. However, you have to pay every month and the 3 day pass is not enough days for me to experience the gym that's why I don't really like the membership. I wish for better."
214,2492340,2017-06-05,3,Initially I liked this gym and had high hopes that I would enjoy it. The gym is fairly large in size and their hours are good. There is a lot of equipment to use in the facility and there is always a machine available. The gym is always bright and clean. But the vibe of this gym is not what I expected and I was not pleased. The gym seems to mostly men and they can be creepy. I am not comfortable in this type of environment. It's not a very female friendly gym. LA fitness did not meet my expectations from when I joined. I cancel my membership after the initial contract period was over.
215,2492388,2017-06-05,5,"I like how there are enough machines that there aren't really any waits to use the machines you want. There is a polite and great staff there and you can get help with whatever you need. It's an overall friendly environment to everyone. One thing I think every gym should include is complimentary protein powder, or have built in music to machines that you can plug in headphones to."
216,2492433,2017-06-04,4,"I chose to go to LA fitness centers for the opening hours, the amount of equipment available and the convenience. I appreciate the kids club and the indoor basketball court. The gym has met my expectations. LA Fitness is a great gym, for a franchise, it has many features I like. However, the clubs can become very crowded and uncomfortable oftentimes making it hard to get in a class."
217,2492481,2017-06-04,4,"LA Fitness has friendly and amazing staff who are easy to work with, a clean place and great prices with the package. I like that the payment options aren't that expensive. It's a great place for me and my family to go to membership. They go above and beyond to help and make me feel at home. My family likes the place also. I love the daycare and I can go whenever I want. They also offer tanning."
218,2492232,2017-06-04,5,"I would choose this gym because the swimming pool was a salt water pool so it was a little better on your skin. I also enjoyed the smoothie bar feature that was available and the gym is clean, open and organized. All of the weights were put up and in order. You can walk in and see everything in a glance. It also felt fresh instead of muggy and sweaty. This gym is nice and it has met my expectations. I would recommend this gym."
219,2492532,2017-06-04,5,"LA Fitness is a twenty-four-hour facility that works around your schedule. I could exercise in my spare time and it was also easy to get to as it was close by. The staff are very helpful and friendly. They have classes, the latest equipment and personal training options. However, they did not have a pool and I really love to swim for exercise, so I left for that reason to a gym that did. Also the only payment option was to have auto payments set up or pay the full amount upfront."
220,2492280,2017-06-04,3,"I like LA Fitness' selection of equipment and machines. They have so many locations which is the main reason that I chose it over other gyms. They have a lot of classes and childcare that is reliable. I like that they have a pool and the sauna is nice. However, they lack cleanliness. The crowd is not my favorite and whenever I try to stop my membership for a while it is impossible to get them to stop billing me. I am a repeat customer of theirs but the last couple times they made it so difficult that I will not return. Overall they did a very good job. They have food or smoothies and they always have someone on staff there present. The music is not too bad or vulgar. It's a pretty good place altogether."
221,2492337,2017-06-04,4,"I had a friend with a membership and they were able to get me in as guest. First and only gym I've been in. The staff was polite and the place was clean so my expectations were met. There was a smoothy stand, a pool and many equipment to use. The place was big so you didn't have to work out right next to someone. I didn't feel like people were judging me either. However, the locker rooms were not very private. You had to change in front of people and the showers were communal. It also felt like a chore."
222,2492385,2017-06-04,3,"I have a couple friends that go there and I went as a guest a few times. The membership cost was within my budget and I like that I'm not bothered by workers to extend membership like in a lot of places you go to workout. It's also a very clean facility and has relatively new equipment. However, it would be nice if the facility were larger and/or had more equipment. Or if less people would be there at the same time. I really don't like to have to wait to use the equipment."
223,2492427,2017-06-03,4,"The gym was close to my home and more than one of my friends also went there. I usually had a workout buddy and was given recommendations on classes from other people I knew who went there. I liked some of the instructors and classes they had available and their hour of operation also fit well with my schedule at the time that I was going there. I would prefer smaller class sizes though, but other than that I basically had no problems with their services and I am planning on getting a new membership soon."
224,2492475,2017-06-03,5,"I chose this gym because it is very conveniently located, open at hours I love, and has features that others do not. It has TVs on the treadmills and this gym also includes wifi enabled equipment that I can just plug in my headphones. They also have certain classes that are different and are not offered elsewhere. It has highly met my expectations due to the features and the location. I actually love this gym so I think they are fine."
225,2492226,2017-06-03,5,"I chose LA fitness as it was the closest to my house. The atmosphere of the gym is very clean and the people are friendly. I am never treated poorly or inferior to others who are working out here. There are also many different exercise equipment to choose from. This gym has everything that I am looking for in a gym and has met all the expectations I have. However, I would like the experience to be more personal but other than that my gym experience has always been very well and I have fun."
226,2492523,2017-06-03,5,"LA fitness has met every expectation. As soon as I walked in, the vibe there was very welcoming and the people were very nice. It would be awesome if they had a pool, but overall, the facility is clean and I felt very comfortable there. I would definitely go back and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me where a awesome gym was."
227,2492274,2017-06-03,5,"I love the fact that LA fitness gym has a sauna!! It had me sold at the door. It's the best thing about it besides having all the equipment you can think of. I was really nervous the first time I came only because of some past experiences with rude people, who think the equipment is theirs, but because there was an abundance of space and equipment, I had no issues at all. I enjoyed the time I spent in this gym. I have heard that some individuals complained about the people at the front desk being rude when you first come in but that was something that I never experienced thankfully. I went in and was greeted by the employees at the front desk, then did a good two and a half hour workout and then hit the sauna and showered. After that I was good to go. The showers were very nice too and the bathrooms were kept clean. Overall my experience with this gym was great. It still is to this day my favorite. It went above my expectations and I will keep coming as long as I am able."
228,2492583,2017-06-03,5,"I like the space and privacy, the amenities, the vibe, as well as the equipment and classes in general. I get excellent results here as well as accessories, clothing and workout wear, and healthy options for nutrition. But, I would only choose to increase hours of classes or times the gym is open in general and to consider opening more locations as to adhere to the convenience of the clientele of the gym. Other than that, the gym has met my expectations and then some. It's an excellent facility that has earned its renowned reputation. I have always been particular about gyms because I am someone who values privacy in a group workout setting. This gym absolutely adheres to that preference and the members there respect that."
229,2492331,2017-06-03,5,"The gym has exceeded my expectations. The staff is always friendly and is very helpful and so are their personal trainers. They offer a lot of different classes that you can take. The spin classes and Zumba are some of my favorite things to do while I am there. There seems to be something for everyone and at every level of fitness. I like that they are nonjudgmental there and also have lot of different equipment so you can work on different problem areas. I also love that they have a pool that you can work out in as well. This is the best gym that I have ever attended. I am very happy with my membership here. Me and my family enjoy coming here and if anything changes we probably would not have the same feelings toward the gym that we have now. The staff, classes, pool everything is perfect just the way it is. The only thing that would make it slightly better would be to have the location closest to me be a 24 hour facility. As it is not now, closes early. This does not allow me to go at some of the times I would like to because of work and other family arrangements that I already have. My being able to go at any time day or night would be great. I would love to be able to get out after the kids and my husband got to sleep."
230,2492379,2017-06-03,3,"LA fitness was closest to me and they had at least 6 racquetball courts to use. They also let me try it out for free for the day. But I didn't like that there wasn't space to put your belongings in while you were utilizing the courts. Our stuff just stayed on the floor and anyone could've stopped by and taken our stuff. Also, the gym was way too big!! For the amount of space they had, there weren't enough people there to justify as to why they needed that much space. I also didn't like that I had to pay a fee to utilize the courts. That didn't seem fair. Other than those the gym did meet my expectations and then some."
231,2492424,2017-06-02,5,"LA fitness has better weights and dumbbells, unlike a gym I had went to before that had rust on the weights and made my hands turn orange. Also they had a variety of different weights that let me gain muscles in every area of my body. I also can get tone faster in this gym. And they have better curl bars so I can lift heavy weight without the weight tearing my hands up. But the gym could be a little cleaner. Sometimes people leave the flatbench seat full of sweat and I have to wipe it, but that isn't the gym's fault, it's the person's fault. Overall this gym is the best and it has met my expectations."
232,2492472,2017-06-02,4,"I love LA fitness. They have such a large variety of services and machinery. There's options for everyone. There's classes and trainers, tanning and so much more. I chose LA fitness that I have had because the level of service and attention you get is above and beyond most other local gyms. LA fitness trainers keep me motivated and focused. The only thing that I could try to improve is possibly extending some hours of operation in my current area. Most of the time the hours work for me but sometimes they don't."
233,2492223,2017-06-02,3,"I received a coupon for a free membership and went to LA Fitness to claim it and stayed there for an additional 6 months. They have a good selection of free weights and machines that i was looking for but sometimes I had to wait to use the ones I wanted. They also offered different classes like yoga but I never took part. Plus, it had a basketball court that always had people ready to play. But a couple of times, there were fights on the basketball court that were not dealt with quickly by the employees. It could also get really crowded because the one I went to was not a very big place and could get hot in there when it was busy. But I know they had an ac because it would be cool during non-peak times."
234,2492520,2017-06-02,5,I went to a couple gyms with friends and even went to a couple with my family but none of them seemed to be the right fit or have any of the classes I wanted to take during the day or night. But I love my gym. When I walk in LA fitness there are rows and rows and rows of exercise equipment. There are so many running bikes and machines that sometimes I don't know where to start. But I don't like how people are always staring at me because I seem to be the biggest person there. They should invent time frames for people that are uncomfortable around some people and do not like the way their body looks.
235,2492271,2017-06-02,5,"LA Fitness has great equipment, awesome people and great staff. The equipment is always kept clean and the staff are polite. The meatheads aren't as crazy as Planet Bitchness makes them out to be. I hope they will have more cleaning equipment but other than that, the service and environment are top notch. I wouldn't trade it for anything. It would be 100% safe to assume that this gym has met my expectations and then some."
236,2492580,2017-06-02,4,"This gym had a great setup for cardio. It had many options and lots of equipment so that you could basically get on your pick of a machine at any time. Also the weight machines were setup so that you could just go from one to the next and get a full workout without having to think about what to do next. Childcare and location were my main reasons for choosing this gym. Childcare was available for up to 4 children and they had morning and afternoon hours available, which helped drastically with my knee. But a women's area in this giant gym would be really nice. I don't necessarily think that the cardio needs to be separated because with that you are in your own space, but trying to use free weights around a bunch of groaning men is a little uncomfortable for me personally. I think a spot women can go and lift without waiting forever or being stared at would encourage more free weight lifting."
237,2492328,2017-06-02,5,"I chose this gym because of location in proximity to my house. It is a quick drive but not local enough where I see too many people. I love this gym. I like the large space, very clean and pool to exercise in as well. There is never a wait for machines or weights which is great to have a quick workout. Every time I have gone I have had such a great experience and refer my friends."
238,2492376,2017-06-02,4,"It's the most convenient to my location and they have lots of machines in very good condition. It's clean and makes me feel energized to work out there. I also prefer their trainers, environment and overall vibe. The staff is friendly and welcoming. But should have more merchandise to buy, more spacious locker room facilities, more discounts on the memberships fees and some special classes would be good."
239,2492430,2017-06-01,5,"I chose this gym because the prices were right. It was not too expensive and had a perfect plan for what I was looking for. I know many people who go here so that is why I decided to try it out. I also like the fact that the staff encourages an atmosphere of non competition and I can go in and not feel judged. The equipment is also always in tip top shape. However, I do not like how there are so many weights, but not enough cardio machines. Also, sometimes, people do not wipe down the machines after they use them and I feel like there should be more signs or more cleaning materials and a greater encouragement to wipe down the machines. It makes me feel a little gross when that happens. But overall, I have been happy with the experience and it has met my expectations. I like the gym and I plan on going back very often."
240,2492478,2017-06-01,5,This gym was definitely one that you got what you paid for. It's my favorite and will continue to be my favorite as time goes on. This gym was of a higher standard. Everything was extremely clean and up to date and the pool and hot tub are amazing features. I also loved the fact that there are courts to play racketball. The main thing that I wish this gym would encompass is later hours. My schedule only allows me to use the gym late at night and I'm no longer able to use this gym because of that. But I loved using this gym and it is still the best gym I've ever used.
241,2492229,2017-06-01,4,"Great place to work out. I chose this gym because my spouse is a member. It offers a wide variety of exercise equipment and there is also an extensive cardio section which is nice to have. While there are a lot of machines to use so you're not necessarily having to wait in line, the gym always feels overcrowded. The gym met my expectations but I would rather ride a bike or play tennis or swim than work out in a gym."
242,2492529,2017-06-01,3,"LA fitness has basketball courts and I love it. I can go there and get into a pickup game very easy. The people in the gym are very nice and there are never issues with violence or people smack talking. However, it is not very tidy at the one I go to. There are towels everywhere and the workers do not seem to be very motivated to clean up. They do try and help the people though. Nevertheless, I picked this one because it is cheaper, it is closer to where I live and I can basically walk there if I wanted to. The price point is basically unbeatable, especially for someone with my lack of money to spend per month."
243,2492334,2017-06-01,5,"I loved everything at the gym, everything was amazing. The machines are well cleaned and not broken. The treadmills are great and I love the pool. The bathrooms are really good too. The showers are all nice and clean like they should be. But the thing I loved the most about LA fitness was the personal trainers. They really help you out and motivate you to keep going and to not give up. The people are nice and the drink service is really good. But one time I was there I got this front desk clerk that was just a little snippy and rude but she was probably just having a bad day. Other than that, the gym has a great atmosphere."
244,2492382,2017-06-01,5,"They have the best locations of any gym in the city. I enjoy going to this chain far more than any other I have ever been a part of. The staff is always friendly and very well mannered. The gym is kept clean and machines always work. There are plenty of workout stations and machines to use. The stationary bikes are always wiped down and well kept up. Free weight area is also kept up and organized. There seems to be enough of everything to go around. But hope they more open spaces, better quality free weights, basketballs for basketball courts as there never seem to be enough of them and better racquetball facilities."
245,2474943,2017-05-31,1,"They billed 14 more times on a offside account since the day we parted. I complained about it to LA Fitness. They allegedly did not know of the incident. My child said nonsense to him and they called and canceled my account and said we were supposedly used the membership card. I am officially after the promoter who has stolen money every month and paying double from what we agreed to pay. This illegal misconduct earns LA Fitness official reputation for on right theft. There is evidence for 14 months money have been drawn out of a foreign credit card and for months LA Fitness was stealing from me. The company should be in court for misleading advertising, billing violations, illegal promotions, and lying. There is enough evidence to order LA Fitness for criminal and financial suit against LA Fitness with evidence of bank transactions from LA Fitness and initial card that was supposedly used that they somehow billed a foreign card for months now. This illegal billing should be a felony charge against LA Fitness employee involved with the billing cycle. Every account of violations is credible with evidence from the day they lied about account freezing which is videotaped to the day we parted and kept billing illegally. The amount of money lost is a scar in my eyes. It feels so red with tears running down my cheeks. Illegal billing should be a serious crime. I will make sure it is."
246,2492439,2017-05-31,4,I chose LA fitness because it is in my area and is easy to access when I need to at any time of the day. I like the range of equipment and that they're open 24 hours. It has what I need and is available to my schedule. They also have aids who will assist you on matters that you desire. Their pricing being a little cheaper would be great but it's reasonable when compared to expensive gyms like Golds Gym. I wish they had a few extra machines that I would use but have quantity over variety for some of their machines.
247,2492487,2017-05-31,4,"LA Fitness has a good reputation and they have one of the better rates in my location. It's got a great location from my house and I got a good deal for the membership. They also have a great variety of equipment, great environment, and the atmosphere is never intimidating. They have friendly and helpful staff. But as with every gym it can get boring and repetitive. I would recommend for them to have classes in different varieties and add other amenities like a nice steam shower area."
248,2492238,2017-05-31,4,I chose this gym because it was only a couple miles from work which made it easy to attend the gym at a regular schedule. Also a co-worker of mine joined so I had a built-in partner to try to motivate me to attend the gym regularly. There was also a good incentive with no sign-up fee and a very reasonable monthly rate for sign up. There were even racquetball courts that were often open for use not requiring appointments. There were also fairly new machines and plenty of them for the amount of clientele that workout at the gym so that there are always open machines to use. The gym was overly well kept but there is often weights placed all around. Most of this was either by not informing the clients there the weight should be put away and their work staff to readily pick them up and put them away. Those weights often presented tripping hazards or made certain weights unavailable to be utilized only to find the dumbbell weight that you needed all the way across the gym while you're working out on another machine.
249,2492547,2017-05-31,4,"I like how LA Fitness has good hours and how they make it easy to get to. I like how they also make it into being something very fun, different and better because how have special trainers. I think it is great and they have all they can to make it better for what I want as well. However, I think they should expand things out so we can get more people in it and make more machines available as well."
250,2492292,2017-05-31,5,"My trainers are encouraging and attentive plus they are closer to my home. They do not judge and work with long time clients in regards to their memberships. They check to see if you are doing the proper exercise to benefit your set goals. They also provide health tips to encourage proper diet. They also encourage members to bring friends and family members. Plus, they have a daycare. I like their treadmills but they need a swimming pool and low impact machines. They can also benefit from their hours of operations. Whenever a goal is met trainers encourage members to set other goals."
251,2492343,2017-05-31,4,"LA fitness has a large amount of equipment to use and make sure everything is super clean. Cleanliness is super important for me in a gym. I also like the classes offered because they are so varied. However there are too many people to find dates instead of working out. They spend extra time on equipment, others are waiting for while not actually working out. Other than that, I absolutely love the hours and location. Both help me to be able to maintain my busy work and family schedule and still work out. This is an invaluable service."
252,2472834,2017-05-30,5,I loved that gym. It was huge and had many amenities and options for personal training. I loved the style and all the equipment and showers plus it was very clean inside and out. It was definitely the gym of choice for my peers if you had the money to join and the pool was the best part. I definitely wish I was back in Florida so I could continue my membership there. The only thing I didn't like was it wasn't 24 hours and it was in the city so it was a densely populated area and sometimes it was hard to park plus it was very expensive to have a membership there but this was 6 years ago.
253,2472963,2017-05-30,4,"LA fitness has exceeded my expectations. The main reason I chose this gym is because they offer a variety of classes in addition to the basic workout machines and weights. I also enjoy the fact that LA Fitness has mostly women as clients and their classes are fantastic. The people that work there are friendly and very helpful. The gym itself is clean and usually not very crowded leaving the workout machines such as the treadmill or the elliptical open when you want to use it. Most places have a long wait which can be annoying and discouraging. There are only a few things that I dislike about this gym. I wish the dressing rooms were more private. Also, sometimes when you go to take a class they are so full that there aren't enough yoga mats, or step aerobic boxes for everyone. Most of the time you just show up for class. I think for classes where you need to use a specific tool there should be a sign-in sheet. This would make it much easier and a lot less likely that the class will be too crowded. I also think there should be a separate room for classes. It's very awkward to be in a class while others are doing their own workout watching you. But I really enjoy this gym."
254,2492421,2017-05-30,3,"LA fitness is spacious and has good atmosphere, pool, sauna and lots of weights. I got a free membership and turned it into a paid one. This gym was in the area and was very attune to customers. The trainers were friendly and individual tvs at machines were a great asset. I approve it and I also liked that there was a daycare. However, they do not have enough towels and they're expensive. There was a lot of gym bros. I liked it overall though. It was very nice."
255,2473011,2017-05-30,3,"It was the gym closest to my job. I had to pass by it on my way home from work, so it was very convenient. The price wasn't too bad either so that helped. I like the large building layout and the staff. Classes were easy to find and staff was helpful. The amenities were clean and well-maintained, even with the high volume of traffic. But, I didn't like the class schedule. Not enough variety. I like zumba and other aerobics but I also want strength training classes that are challenging and not some variation of high intensity interval training."
256,2473059,2017-05-30,4,"Sometimes I think it's a little pricey compared to other places and I don't like how crowded it can be some nights. I also don't like that sometimes it gets very hot in there. I chose it mainly because of how close it is to me and it has met my expectations from what other have told me in the past, it also has kind of exceeded certain expectations with how well run they seem to be there. I thought that because they seem crowded, they would be a mess but they are not. I think it's a very friendly environment, they keep their equipment in good shape, and I never feel self conscious there."
257,2492517,2017-05-30,3,"I chose this gym for location and convenience. But it does not align well with my fitness goals which are more strength based. The knowledge of the trainers is limited as I could not find anyone who was a CSCS. And I was unable to find a trainer to suit my needs, which was disappointing. I think the facility could stand to get more squat cages and lifting platforms. Being unable to do Olympic lifts impedes my strength programming. However, they have a wide variety of free weights and weight machines. Open layout, not intimidating. I like the sauna and childcare which is a huge issue and a barrier for many people. The pool is great as well. LA fitness is okay for average fitness enthusiast."
258,2492268,2017-05-30,5,"I liked that LA fitness had a diverse clientele that wasn't just a bunch of hard bodies and it had helpful people working there. It was a large gym with many choices of equipment, and several of each type, which meant I didn't have to wait to use the machine I wanted to. It was also conveniently located to where I lived at the time. However, the parking lot could have been larger as it was hard to find a parking spot when they were busy. The carpet could also be updated as it seemed grungy and worn out and I would have preferred to have more privacy in the shower area."
259,2473119,2017-05-30,4,"Best gym ever. They make me feel like I am not fat and I like to feel that way. They have plenty of equipment for me and my family to workout at. I like this gym because it makes me feel special and they always have tons of towels, they have a pool and basketball court with free to rent balls. The net is always working and the court is always clean. I wish it was closer to my house. I have to drive forty five minutes to get to the gym. Also, I wish they had a cafe there and they have more people there so I could play basketball with when I go."
260,2492325,2017-05-30,4,"I like LA Fitness and I chose this gym because of the proximity to my home and the low monthly fee. The pool is usually available. The gym is clean and the staff is friendly. I like the classes. They are interesting. The class times are convenient too. The same people go to the classes so there's a sense of community. I like the clientele of the gym. But they should have maybe more equipment or newer equipment. The television channels are bad too. Also, I wish more people went to the classes. Sometimes it's awkward when no one shows."
261,2473167,2017-05-30,5,"LA Fitness met my expectations and I really enjoyed it. The staff was very helpful in showing me the right exercises and equipment to use so that I didn't hurt myself and so I could get the maximum use of the entire facility. My favorite part is the exercise classes. They don't exhaust you and you really feel refreshed after a good workout. The only thing I might change is the location it sits in. It's very dark at night. Other than that, the staff and the other people exercising were all great. I would recommend it as well as choose it again."
262,2472915,2017-05-30,5,"I enjoy the fact that I can exercise however I want at any time I want. I also like how there is plenty of ways to exercise and that it is clean and efficient. They have an extremely friendly staff who I can joke around with and exercise with, the staff has become like my second family and I'm glad they're around to motivate me when I don't feel like working out. They're always kind and don't judge your body. The people that exercise there have plenty of manners and I appreciate that. However, it would be nice if the gym had a smoothie bar to make shakes and protein drinks to drink while exercising. I wish the locker room was a bit bigger but it's somewhat fine the way it is. Moreover, I don't like the treadmills, they're rough against my feet but I think all treadmills are like that."
263,2492373,2017-05-30,2,"It was a nice environment and very pleasant place to be. I like the building. Other people who go to the gym are kind and willing to help you if you don't know what you are doing. However, the water has issues and the workers are very forceful and intimidating to get you into a contract then letting you have a free day with your friend pass; which is very scummy business practice. The heavy weights were on the second floor which makes no sense and it doesn't have a good program set into place. And also 100% overpriced for being a student. Overall, it made me shy into opening to other places to go to the gym since my experience was so stressful. I feel like it would be better if I would just do 200 pushups, squats, crunches, leg lifts and 20 mins of yoga at home to feel more comfortable than there."
264,2472996,2017-05-29,3,"It has large size, double floors, a rowing machine and large locker room and showers. Many machines so you don't have to wait so long, and the variety available. However, I dislike the Cleanliness and smell. It smells really dank. I don't like having to change gyms so I wish there was better maintenance or materials used so that it would seem cleaner. I would renovate the gym more often or install better flooring. Also maybe give people incentives to exercise not all at the same time, maybe a discount on the membership fee, or premium for peak hours. Also it would be great if a certain amount of visitors were allowed within a month."
265,2492457,2017-05-29,4,"I like the variety of class options and times and the quantity and variety of workout machines, which were always kept clean and in good condition. My friend is a member there and I like to work out with a buddy. The gym was open, clean, and well lit. The staff was friendly and helpful whenever I had a question. On the other hand, their cancellation policy needs to include a clause for an individual that moves to a town more than 50 miles away from the nearest LA fitness. I moved in with my parents to help them around the house before my personal training contract was up. I was more than 50 miles from the nearest gym but they would not allow me to cancel."
266,2473044,2017-05-29,2,"A big factor why I chose LA fitness happens to be the fact that my old gym closed down. So I had very little options, and went because it was all that was near my house that was affordable. My dad was attending and paying for me so we could workout together. It has its pros and cons. I liked what they had to offer for classes. I also had lots of friends and family who were apart of the gym which made it much easier for me to go. Racketball court is also a plus. However, it's too open. The one in my area is a little on the small side, compared to my old gym (my old gym was also my favorite gym). The people are typically unfriendly. It's also incredibly busy all hours of the day."
267,2492505,2017-05-29,2,"I like the pool and the spa at LA Fitness. That is the main reason I chose to join that gym. However, I would improve the cleanliness of the pool and spa area. There is always a funky sewage smell on one side of the pool. While I know they try to fix the problem, they obviously have a major plumbing infrastructure issue. Also, the treadmill area is always crowded and it's hard to find a machine. Still, LA Fitness is close to the house. There are other gyms nearby but this is the closest pool and spa. Otherwise, I would change gyms due to the smelly pool area."
268,2492256,2017-05-29,5,"The staff are helpful and friendly, and helped me get the best workout with the least amount of pain or struggle. They are always sweet and nurturing towards my health. I felt great afterward and always want to go back for more!!! The gym tends to get humid. So they are going to install dehumidifier and better ventilation systems!!! Also, there is a lot of background noise but it was drowned out by music."
269,2473104,2017-05-29,3,"I have been a member of many gyms and LA Fitness is my favorite. They have a fair amount of locations where I live and have a good variety of equipment and a lot of space. The locker rooms /bathrooms are always clean in my area. The one I go to just got renovated and it looks great. It has a pool and a basketball court. If I'm in the mood for a smoothie, I can head right downstairs and get one. It is not 24/7 but that is ok and I can also use all of the locations. While I'm not too big on things like Zumba and kickboxing, the few classes I've tried were fun. I am overall satisfied with this gym. The only down side for me is the cost. Memberships are pricey especially those at the premier clubs or whatever they call the fancier clubs. My other main grief is their terrible pay rate in particular for trainers. People get charged almost fifty per session on top of membership and the trainers only get paid 6 dollars when they're doing all the work. Also, I complained to the manager about everything been thrown all over the floor and they did absolutely nothing about it, when I know they're supposed to walk through the gym regularly throughout the day putting equipment back."
270,2492565,2017-05-29,5,"LA Fitness has the whole package according to my standards. This gym has everything I need to stay fit. They even have a variety of workout classes. I really enjoy the step class that they have and they have a excellent bicycling class that is amazing. I also like the fact that if you do not have a mp3 or some type of listening device then all you need is ear buds and you can hook it up to the machines. You have the option to watch TV or listen to the radio. It's nice because sometimes there may be something you wanted to watch but you had to go and workout. But if I really had to find something that I would change about LA Fitness, it would be that they stay open 24 hours. That would really take the cake."
271,2492313,2017-05-29,5,"I'm not an athletic person and I'm totally out of shape but LA fitness has treadmills and ellipticals inside of their very own movie theater! Didn't even feel like I was working out my body for 2 hours. The second story has a track that I walk on, and a gorgeous basketball court. The swimming pool is very nice too. However the monthly rates and memberships are way too expensive for me and I couldn't continue going there. Was a total bummer. Nevertheless I didn't think gyms like that were possible. I never once felt judged or creeped out. Everybody does their own thing and doesn't bother anybody else. Would recommend to anyone."
272,2473152,2017-05-29,5,"The location and ease of getting to the gym are convenient. Basketball and racquetball courts are nice and usually available. The pool is clean and well maintained. The gym and locker room was clean and neat as well. Also, the daycare for the kids while you workout is huge. Never have to wait for equipment, am able to do my workout and go home. They have hours for my needs and generally got my workout in without being disrupted. But I don't like the rock climbing wall or other activities that are separate of exercise. Also, the personal trainers seemed disinterested and were in their phones during my workout."
273,2472900,2017-05-29,5,"There are a lot of features that I enjoy about LA Fitness. First I really like the juice, it's awesome. I also enjoy the sauna and personal training options available. The personal trainer and the facility are also really, really nice. I had nothing but good experiences each time I've gone to the facility. The only thing I really dislike the price. It's a little expensive to sign up and pay month to month. I understand all the many amenities that LA Fitness offers, you expect it to cost a little more that the competition but it a little too expensive. But overall, LA Fitness is a Great gym."
274,2492361,2017-05-29,4,"I started going to LA fitness because I got a good price to sign up. I started there because I like the atmosphere and the staff are always nice, helpful, friendly and willing to work with you! I prefer larger gyms so I have options when I go there. However, too many people sometimes. Because it is such a big gym in my area, a lot of people go there to work out. I've had to leave a couple classes due to them being too crowded or didn't get a chance to use cardio machines because they are all taken up when I get there. Otherwise, there are many options for classes and workout machines. Sometimes I use the free weights, but overall cardio machines and the classes are my main routines. Also, LA is one of the only gyms with a basketball court!"
275,2472948,2017-05-29,5,I like the layout and it's close to home. It was BAC which I went to before and they switched to LA fitness. The same clientele and workers so I didn't see a change in my regular routine. I like the juice bar and classes. I also like how they offer personal trainers and a special women's only section for weights. I like that they have lots of equipment and the price is reasonable. I enjoy this gym very much. There is nothing that I dislike other than sometimes the music is annoying. I use my own headphones so it doesn't bother me.
276,2492409,2017-05-29,5,I love that they have everything. It feels like for the price that I pay for this gym it's actually worth my money. I love this gym and it's honestly the best. I can be here all day and I hope everyone starts coming to this gym. It has so much more equipment. It's way more spacious than any other gym I know of.
277,2473002,2017-05-28,4,"I was grandfathered into LA fitness when they took over my local gym in Rochester New York, but I would have joined this gym over my other options in my smaller sized city. The price is good for the quality of gym, especially compared to more expensive yet worse gyms locally. There are quite a few locations that are close enough to me, and the gym does exactly what I need it to do. The gym is always pretty clean, there is always plenty of equipment even during the busy hours, when it's not busy I have my choice of any equipment I want, there is plenty of weight for my needs plus a pool, hot tub, sauna, and basketball court if I choose to use it. The hours are quite good as well. The staff isn't rude, but they are not exactly friendly. The bathroom is sometimes out of order and kinda of small. The free wifi doesn't work very well. The locker room design is horrible. It's made to house a lot of lockers but doesn't give nearly enough space if there are a few people in this area of congested lockers. Lastly there are not enough drinking fountains for the size of the gym and the number of members that can be in such a large space."
278,2492460,2017-05-28,4,"While it looks very clean and modern, it's too modern to the point of making our stay there while working out not comfortable. But it's nice and generally makes you think of a hospital which encourages you to work out because you're thinking, what happens if I don't work out? Will I go to the hospital? I like it but I would make it less cold. Also, it had competitive pricing. The one I went to had daycare which is perfect for people with children and need to work out. It made me more inclined to visit the gym since it is more accessible for a lot of people which makes the gym more equal and awesome."
279,2473050,2017-05-28,5,I chose this gym because it is close to my house and I have lots of friends who really like it. They go there and they recommended it. I like the gym. There are lots of machines and there was always someone there to help and I learned a lot. There are also a lot of people there to help you learn all the machines. I like the people and the staff so I will pick this one again.
280,2492508,2017-05-28,4,I enjoyed using LA Fitness' services for the strength of my own body. Their gym really helps to enhance your performance and physical body skills. I like everything there is to like about this gym and it does not disappoint me in any way. I love the coaches there too. They are very self motivating and help you unlock skills that you have never known about. I like this gym the best overall because it is very convenient and it has a nice inviting atmosphere. I would recommend LA Fitness to anyone in need of physical or mental exercise.
281,2492259,2017-05-28,5,"I chose this gym because they have a lot more equipment, there is never a long wait for the machines I want to use and tanning included. Also they offer personal trainings and my membership is very reasonably priced. I like that there is plenty of room in the gym to move around without bumping into others. It's very clean and the staff is very friendly. They are always willing to help when they can. But I don't like that the gym is kind of far from my home. So I don't get to go on the weekends."
282,2473110,2017-05-28,5,"I choose LA Fitness for its towel service, big lockers, saunas, pool, updated equipment and it’s generally clean. It also has locations that are convenient to my life e.g., near home and work. It has met most of my expectations and is convenient in cost for services. I like that the studios are often open for personal use without back to back classes all day. But equipment repairs take much too long and the showers need to be kept cleaner. I would also like longer hours of operation especially on the weekends. It's difficult to have an evening workout when the gym closes at 8pm."
283,2492568,2017-05-28,2,"My husband and I picked this gym based on location and amenities even if it was pricier than others. I enjoyed the variety of equipment available so it was easy to find a machine that worked the muscles I wanted to or to find a free weight bench that was the right style for the exercise I wanted to do. The sauna and pool for less intense excessive and relaxing after a workout were also greatly appreciated. However, the biggest flaw I encountered with the gym was the childcare hours. They made it practically impossible for me to come in with my children because of work and school hours. The time that did work for me was always so busy in the gym that I'd have to wait two or three people to get a turn on any machine. Also, aside from the gym lacking items for my children to play with, our children (8 & 6) couldn't use the pool even with us right there. So overall, the gym didn't meet my expectations."
284,2492316,2017-05-28,3,"This gym is the only choice in area close to my home that made the commute doable. There were not really any other choices that were nice in the general area unless I added a commute. Plus I did know a few people that went there so it was nice to see a familiar face when I walked in. LA fitness had a lot of equipment. They had plenty of treadmills and the facility seemed clean. However, every time I walked in I felt awkward and unsure where to start. There were some serious people working out and I felt embarrassed walking up to a machine unsure how to properly use it."
285,2473158,2017-05-28,4,"I know there are other gyms that are nicer but I like the price I pay each month at LA Fitness. And I chose this gym because it's close by my house and I got grandfathered in so the monthly payment is very affordable. The gym has good hours and are open sometimes during holidays. I can count on them to be open. The gym has a lot of variety too. I can swim, play basketball, lift weights, and cardio. I can also take classes there. I am overall happy and satisfied with LA Fitness. They are a reliable brand name. But I wonder if they wipe down the machines every day."
286,2472906,2017-05-28,5,LA fitness has been better than the one I been before. Better quality. Very nice people who work there. Help you out if you are having trouble with the machines and tell you how you're suppose to use. It's so expanded. They have a lot of machine to workout and different machines that I never knew existed. Gym employers are not rude like some other gyms I been to. The one I been to was only a one level gym so I would say make it more level because it does get full of people. I really like this gym. They treat you really nice and don't have judging face looking at you.
287,2492364,2017-05-28,4,LA fitness has a good deal and good variety of equipment I can use and it works with my fitness plan exactly. I like the lockers and showers and the equipment which is easy to use for first time users. I often use the bike and treadmill as gaining mass is not my goal. But I would like if the showers could be more private and if staff were more available. Trainers seem very busy all the time. Otherwise everything is good enough for me.
288,2472954,2017-05-28,3,"I was originally with Bally for many years until LA Fitness bought them out so I stayed with LA Fitness because they honored Bally's rates. LA Fitness and Bally's contract allowed me to stay with them. I like LA Fitness’ long hours, various locations, up to date equipment, gym cleanliness, steam room, showers, sauna room, swimming pool, how the membership is recognize in other states, ability to upgrade membership and the company's stability. I like the fact that they have someone to show you how to use the equipment properly, the workout classes, water workout classes, personal trainers optional, available paper towels and cleaning spray for members to use, the membership key card, vendor machines on site and cleaning staff on duty to continuously wipe down the equipment. But I dislike the cost, young evening crowd, mentality of some of the workers, family add-on program expense, and that they're not very competitive with other gym setups."
289,2492412,2017-05-28,5,"I like the availability of equipment. LA fitness has convenient location and the hours are great. I can fit my workout into my schedule. I also like the trainers and their willingness to help as much as possible to create a healthy workout. The trainers help to develop healthy eating plans and make suggestions about what could work in my daily schedule. They also discuss healthy alternatives when eating out and what good choices might be on a menu. I also like that the trainer is always there so I can't fall back into bad habits. I have someone to make sure I stay on track. I am losing weight and feel motivated to continue. I feel successful and happy with the progress that is being made. I am starting to buy new clothes in smaller sizes which is a great feeling. On the other hand, I would like to see more privacy in the locker rooms. I do not feel comfortable seeing people undressed and often the people undressed are comfortable and don't care. It is very awkward. I wish there were separate areas for people who want more privacy from those who choose to let it all hang out. I want to feel comfortable in my own skin and not feel self-conscious either. I also feel concerned about the issue of people being openly gay. I do not like the idea that someone may look at me in that way. I would prefer to have everyone properly dressed in main areas of the locker room so that everyone is comfortable and can have access to the same gym services. It is a reason to consider working out at home instead."
290,2472960,2017-05-27,4,I wouldn't really consider other gyms except Gold's Gym. My friend got me into LA fitness. My friend goes to this gym so I chose it. It's close to where I live and I like that there are many of it all over the country. I like the different classes they offer and the staff is friendly. I like the variety of the equipment too. But I would like later classes and maybe a protein shake shop inside. I would also like a cross fit or HIIT class. In addition I would also like an indoor track and pool and maybe the gym should be slightly bigger.
291,2492463,2017-05-27,4,"L.A. is modern and affordable for what it offers. I like the people that go there. The trainers there are amazing. It offers my family and I a very great place to be healthy and fit. My whole family really likes this place and we are all satisfied with the value and convenience we receive as members of LA Fitness. My gym is very close to home and very convenient for my family and I. It's comfortable, has a very great staff and the equipment is up to date. I love my gym but there is always room to improve and no one is perfect. Sometimes I think that the price of membership is high. There should be discounts, coupons or perks for being a very loyal member. Sometimes, I think it would be nice to put a whirlpool in the ladies room!"
292,2473008,2017-05-27,5,"It was close to my home. The pricing and programs were both appealing and affordable. I have absolute comfort in my experiences here and I would not consider leaving and trying to reinvent what I have found here. I had several friends that worked out there. I was impressed with their regimen and I was curious. I like the trainers and their focus on your fitness goals. I like their willingness to instruct you. I was reluctant to begin training but now, I am glad that I have begun. I find acceptance and I am comfortable in my surroundings. I am making steady progress towards my fitness goals and I am complimented by others on my achievement. I also like the availability of gyms and their reputation and longevity. I readily inform others on my experiences at this particular gym."
293,2492511,2017-05-27,5,"I like the fact that you can bring a friend to LA fitness. I love the fact that it has an indoor pool so that even when it's rainy I can get my exercise in the pool. They also have a training techniques and classes that you could attend at the gym going on 24 hours a day. It has enough equipment so that I don't have to wait all the time on equipment when other people are there. However, I don't like the fact that you have to pay so much. The gym gives you great features but the price is very costly. A lot of people would be at LA Fitness but they can't afford them. The price needs to come down. Other than that the gym definitely meet my expectations."
294,2473056,2017-05-27,3,"I dislike the contract and the inability to quit it. They were very pushy about you buying product. I also don't like that people were not there to work out but to socialize. It became a social thing versus a gym. On the other hand, I like that it was very big with plenty of equipment, which are usually available and clean and people were nice and very helpful. It is very convenient to my home and work and it meets my needs, but would be nice to have a month to month contract. For a cheaper price also, but overall it's nice."
295,2492262,2017-05-27,5,"I like the set up of the equipment and how it's all organized. I also enjoy the fact that there is a theater room, where I can watch movies and exercise on a treadmill or elliptical in the dark. That's relaxing. I really enjoy the sauna after my workout, as well as the pool, that's a huge plus as I love to swim. However I would improve the locker room area, the showers. But overall I feel like the gym itself is pretty sufficient in the variety of machines, rooms, pool, equipment, etc. I chose this gym because of all the things it had to offer, mainly the pool, as well as all the variety. It very much met my expectations. The machines always worked, everything was always sanitary and the staff was always professional and friendly."
296,2473116,2017-05-27,3,"I chose the gym because of convenient location from work and school as well as it offered a pool and a personal trainer. The gym met standard expectations of a gym. It's fairly average. There was a lot of space to work out on new equipment, as well as there was a pool. I enjoyed all the activities being offered as well as the option to have a personal trainer. That helps significantly with health goals. I would suggest having a tanning area because for the price of the membership that should be offered as well. Not just one or two beds but an actual whole areas so there's not a lot of wait time in between."
297,2492319,2017-05-27,5,"I like being able to use multiple LA fitness gyms. These gyms are all over the county I live in and in neighboring counties. I also like the variety of classes offered. However, the restrooms are often dirty. I stopped showering at the gym because I am tired of seeing used tampons, wads of hair, and gunk in the showers. I have also experienced gyms that have ongoing problems with the air conditioning. I find it hard to believe that the A/C is often broken during heat waves. But LA fitness was bought out by another gym which is one of the reasons I stayed. I think the yearly membership fees are low compared to other gyms or studios."
298,2473164,2017-05-27,4,My friend chose this gym because of its convenient location. It is also wonderful that they allow one guest to come with you since it allowed me to join her and see if I liked the gym. This gym met my standards incredibly. It is very clean and modern which makes it enjoyable to workout since I didn't worry about the equipment being dirty. It was very large and had many different types of equipment and a lot of each equipment so everyone could do as they pleased. I also found it wonderful that the locker rooms were so clean and well maintained. But I wish that the gym had more variety in options on types of classes to join in and become more involved. It would also be nice to have a larger amount of classes.
299,2492367,2017-05-27,4,I chose this gym originally because of location but since I've been there I've learned to like it for many of the reasons. I like the staff at LA Fitness. They're always courteous and willing to go the extra mile to help out the people who use the gym. It's also a very clean gym. It's well maintained and I never notice anything dirty or bad looking. Its cleanliness and staff courtesy are second to none compared to other gyms that I've been a member of. But at times the gym LA fitness can become extremely crowded and overwhelming and you have to wait a long time to use a machine or to use weights and you lose the flow of the workout that you're currently doing.
300,2472912,2017-05-27,5,"Cleanly and spacious humid one of my favorite reasons for choosing LA Fitness. Not a lot do you find space in local gyms the way you do here. From the equipment to the back changing rooms, everything is always smooth and in working order. The rooms for sure help gravitate people inside for class and large enough to have people enjoy an effective workout. Sauna room is immaculate and good space to lounge after an intense workout. I also love the back pool area and fully stocked showers towards the back. LA Fitness is an amazing facility to start. Never had an issue with cleanliness or bad classes. The workers and personal trainers in my experience at LA Fitness for 3 years, I've been very disappointed with the lack of space/bikes in the gym. There's been numerous of times I've missed classes prior because the class was full within 5 mins before class. Small spin rooms really present a problem when wanting to attend a workout class. With bigger rooms, we can accommodate larger amounts of people in these classes and everyone can workout."
301,2492415,2017-05-27,2,"They were friendly and understanding of situations that was going on. Also, they wanted you to come back even if you had bad experiences. I liked that the employees were open to help. However, I didn't like that I had things stolen while I was working out. And the employees told me it was my fault which then after this I have never went back to this gym. I wouldn't chose this gym over other gyms. It is just the one that is closest to where I live. I had no choice in where I went to the gym. Because I didn't want to drive an hour to go to another gym."
302,2492418,2017-05-26,3,"LA fitness is close by my house and work. I can meet my family there, or I can go by myself. It is even close enough for me to go on my lunch break. I liked the anti bacterial wipes they had near or close by to each station. It made me feel more confident that what I was touching was clean. It would help though if the staff would help clean these stations between customers. The dressing room was very close to the pool area which made it hot and stuffy. Maybe they could have raise the air conditioner for that room. Also, the staff is always trying to sell personal training packages on us to the point where if you ask a simple question about how to work some of the equipment they seem reluctant to answer. I also wish they had a smoothie section there on site for afterward."
303,2472972,2017-05-26,5,"LA Fitness has the best people and things you would need. Everyone at the gym is super nice, kind and you could be there all day and the gym would be ok with that. The place is super clean and I love the gym exercise machines but they should put them near the window. They should also have more vending machines for water and food."
304,2492466,2017-05-26,1,LA Fitness was not far from home and the price was ok. But we were not happy with LA Fitness. The staff was extremely annoying and almost to the point of harassment. I called the supervisor because one lady was following my children around but not to help but to sell. She wanted to keep selling personal trainers. She weighed us wrong to make us seem heavier. It was very awkward and she was like a cheesy used car salesman. She gave us phony compliments and trying to upgrade us and we were definitely not interested. The lady kept telling my son that she felt like a mother to him and it was ridiculous. We felt very uncomfortable. She even referred to my daughter as special ed but who is she to diagnose people. Although the equipment was nice but not worth the hassle and nobody wanted to help unless we paid for a personal trainer and we already paid for them. I even spoke to the area supervisor to complain. They still try to send emails and it was 3 years ago. More staff should help without having to pay for a personal trainer. Seriously. It was like having to pay someone just to ask a question. Also the gym was dirty and the hot tub was too crowded. There wasn't another gym close by but since then more privately owned gyms opened up and are more willing to give quality service.
305,2473020,2017-05-26,5,I first chose this gym due to the discount offered through my company and as an added bonus that meant many of my friends and coworkers were also members and so that helped keep me motivated. I love that they do provide daycare at a cost so I can bring my son. I love the trainers and classes especially the spin classes and body class. The machines are also great. I do wish that they would add more daycare providers because it can get full and it's an inconvenience to drive to the gym and have to wait for an opening. I also wish there were more water classes.
306,2492514,2017-05-26,4,"When I went to the LA Fitness, I was greeted happily and they took me on a tour of the 2 story LA Fitness. They have a men's and women's locker room, with a indoor pool, racquetball and all that good stuff. It's pretty fun there. However when I come with a free pass please don't be on me the whole time about getting a membership. Just because I'm visiting doesn't mean you need to take all of my young mula baby. Even though there was a closer Fitness 19 to my house, the LA Fitness just had a way more variety of things to do there, basketball and they even had a little place there that could make you healthy drinks."
307,2492265,2017-05-26,3,I love the ladies only and the babysitting area. I do my cardio outside but I do my stretches and everything else inside where it's nice and quiet. But prices are too high and the contract was hard to get off. They also barely have any offers. They should have offers like the new gyms that are opening up now. They should have a pool and be open 24hrs or earlier or later. It's by my workplace which I work and get off early. I need to go run errands too but they close too early and open too late for me.
308,2473074,2017-05-26,4,"All in all the gym is great. I like the different sections for the different workouts and the friendly helpful staff. I also like that they have a pool, the equipment that they have is all up to date and hi-tech. The instructors there are very helpful with workout suggestions. It's the closest to my house and it has great promotions. I enjoy working out there. The most I have at any gym before. It's never overcrowded and people there are respectful and don't try to bother me. I'd like if they were open 24 hours. I feel like they aren't open as much as they should be. They have early hours but not 24 hours. Sometimes I prefer to workout late at night but I can't do that here because they close around 10."
309,2472852,2017-05-26,5,"The staff there are quite nice. Every LA Fitness I've been to is very spacious and everyone gives you space. The place is often quiet with just a little music playing in the background so you don't get distracted and they always make sure to keep everything including the bathrooms clean. The equipment is very nice and upgraded as well so they're very fun to try out. I'm always pumped and ready to burn couple hundred calories off with their equipment and fun classes! It's very affordable too. I love it! The gym has very much met my expectations, I go there several times a week and LA Fitness is by far the best gym I've been to. My only problem is that I wish they were 24/7 or went to at least 1 in the morning, since I'm more of a night owl I like to work out during nighttime when there isn't much people there."
310,2492574,2017-05-26,4,"LA Fitness was the closest gym to me and I got a good deal when signing up. The gym is also huge with just about any exercise machine you could possibly imagine. The staff are very friendly and laid back, as well. You also have the ability to bring a friend and there's a sauna, and a pool at some locations. But sometimes it could get a bit crowded and the monthly fee is quite high. If there was some way to lower the monthly charge that would be amazing and it would also attract more customers."
311,2492322,2017-05-26,4,Currently LA Fitness is the only gym that is located nearby my home. This location is very comfortable as it's near a grocery store where I can quickly shop after exercising. I can either walk there or drive there in a couple of minutes. I like the variety of equipment available and also the additional group classes offered. The staff is usually quite friendly. The location where I go is quite clean. It would be great though if they would offer free training and nutritional plans to improve my training. They should approach people who are not performing the exercises how they should in order to prevent injuries.
312,2473128,2017-05-26,5,"I chose LA fitness because it is conveniently located near home and work and has state of the art equipment. Hours are also convenient to my work schedule. The clientele are similar to me and it is a fun place to be. They always have a lot of available equipment for me to use. The facilities are great and always maintained immaculately. I love that they have a knowledgeable staff but some of the staff are not all that likable. Even so, I like everything about LA fitness and plan on being a customer there for many years."
313,2492370,2017-05-26,5,"I chose LA Fitness over other gyms is because they have them in many locations all over the United States. So anywhere I went I could go to the gym. Also a lot of my family goes there. I like that they had a lot of classes I could take. However, the LA Fitness I went to did not offer deep and water aerobics. That was the only downside I saw to the gym because deep water aerobics is my favorite class. They also did not offer a multi-step class which I really like. But they had a daycare which helps me out a lot since I have two children. There were also rooms available when instructors are not using them."
314,2473176,2017-05-26,5,"I just love it like anything. Me and my husband work out thrice a week at this place. It's good, conveniently located nearby my residence and timings are flexible so I can do the gym in evening also. Plus, the environment, service and the trainers are good, perfect for anyone having busy life. In fact I recommend it to others."
315,2472924,2017-05-26,4,"This gym was very close to where I live which made it very convenient. If the gym was far away, I would probably not go regularly. The monthly dues were very reasonable. They had a lot of exercise equipment and offered a complimentary workout session with a trainer. It had a pool and they offered different exercise classes to join. However, it would get crowded and I would have to wait to use some of the machines. Sometimes sweaty people wouldn't wipe down the machine after they used it."
316,2472978,2017-05-25,3,"LA Fitness's are always in the cool parts of town! There are lots of attractive men! I like the pool and the vibe of the building. It has a lot to offer! I also like the name. LA makes me think it is more hip and trendy! It looks cool from the outside. It has a cool appeal it. I honestly prefer this gym to most any other. Except Life Time. Their prices are a little higher. But I like everything you get!!! I like it better than others. However, I would like saunas! Everyone loves saunas! Also, more amenities, machines and spa features. I like to have a smoothie place in gym. Also, I love racquetball so courts would be nice."
317,2492445,2017-05-25,3,"I like that LA fitness was conveniently located by my house and that they had a lot of racquetball courts there. The place was very spacious and not a lot of people were there at the time I visited. But I didn't like that the staff was right up front. It presented an intimidating environment especially since all of them were men. Also, the place seemed too big for the amount of people that were there at the time. So far, the gym met my expectations but for the racquetball courts, there was the extra fee that you would have to pay a month if you were a member. Not many people utilize the courts so I didn't understand that fee."
318,2473026,2017-05-25,5,"Terrific, outstanding, and phenomenal. Bathrooms are nice and the equipment is always clean. Everything is perfect for me. It is a great way to get the best of the best. I am a beautiful person who is the most important thing to that gym. When I go there everyone follows me and wants me to teach them how I bulk so fast, what I eat and how much sleep I get. It's closer to my home and I have been working with the same trainer. If the weather is nice, I will have to be the first one to be able to get the best way."
319,2492493,2017-05-25,3,I chose this gym because my husband and cousins come here and I like the options available in the gym. They have different types of equipment for cardio as well as weight training. I also love having a professional person available to help at all times and the most important is that there are tvs on each machine and not just a general tv for everyone. But the gym in my neighborhood moved to another bigger location and what was once 2 miles away is not across town. It’s over 5 miles plus lights and traffic which will take me 15-20 minutes to get there plus back. That's stupid wasted time. I quit that gym but my husband still goes to that gym. Cleanliness is also another issue. The gym should use a clean towel for each machine otherwise they’re just taking people's gross sweat and germs and passing it all around from one machine to another. We also pay the gym for a reason and it’s not to pay salaries for lazy staff to stand around.
320,2492244,2017-05-25,5,"Value for the money is one big reason why I choose this gym over others. It also has lots of variations and new equipment to fully utilize and to be able to workout well. It is well situated in the city and has a big space to workout. It is also well ventilated and well-maintained... However, I would like more new equipment to be able to cope up with the new advancements in the fitness industry. They should also have regular equipment maintenance and cleaning to prevent skin diseases and to promote a healthier workout environment."
321,2473086,2017-05-25,4,"LA fitness has cheap and affordable monthly payments. I chose this gym for the comfort that it brings and also the convenience. There is always an LA fitness around and that makes it easier to get to the gym when I need to. I have noticed that all locations are modern and have new equipment with TVs and that are working properly. Also the customer service has always been great here and I love the spa and pool area. However, I would want there to be more classes at this gym. I also would love to see the price of the personal trainers go down. In addition maybe have more structure sensitivity to overweight clients."
322,2492553,2017-05-25,5,"LA Fitness bought out my old gym and all my friends moved to this one so 1/2 of us moved over. Besides it's much closer to my home than the old one was... It's a large gym with many machines available and is kept very clean and well-organized. Great variety of machines and plenty of them for everyone to use. However, the TV - needs more channels available to watch not just 11 and DirecTV sucks to put it bluntly. Other than that, the gym is perfect for me."
323,2492301,2017-05-25,4,"I chose them for the location and first month was free. They have great hours and liked that they offered Pilates classes at times when I could make them. I like that there are lots of cardio equipment, no waiting for machines and a lot of classes offered. They have friendly staff and not a ton of meat heads and I didn't feel judged or intimidated working out by other members or staff members. But there's no childcare. Also, there could have been more televisions & docking stations on machines for iPhone & other music players. And they could have offered more yoga classes at prime hours after work."
324,2472864,2017-05-25,3,I love how neat and clean the atmosphere is. This gym is closer to my house so it is easy to get to when I want to go. It is so expensive to where that is making me not want to go to this one. It needs to be cheaper.
325,2473134,2017-05-25,5,"LA fitness definitely meets my expectations. They have everything I need in a gym. Any type of exercise equipment or class I might want to take, they make me feel satisfied. I like that I can bring a guest with me whenever I come to the gym. It's nice to bring a friend to keep me company and keep me motivated and anything I look for when I am choosing a gym. The gym does a great job at making me feel good about my membership. It's nice to be able to go to a gym I truly enjoy myself at."
326,2492349,2017-05-25,2,"At first I got a deal through Medicare so because of the cost I went. I went there for only a few months, and during that time a couple times a week. The gym was okay and the equipment was nice. But the gym definitely did not meet my expectations. Everything cost extra,11 so it ended up not being the best deal. Their types of classes and daycare cost. And I really wanted a personal trainer but the cost was too much so I did not get much out of the gym since I did not know what I was doing. I also needed a nutritionist to give me the best type of diet to go with working out but that was not offered. It was also like a meat market and I felt uncomfortable. I would rather go to a all female gym."
327,2472930,2017-05-25,2,"The convenient location is why my husband and I chose this gym. This is great because I work out very early in the morning, and it offers a lot of options as far as activities, equipment, classes, and personal training, but I am not currently happy and looking for a new gym. The staff is extremely rude, the facility is very dirty, and the equipment is poorly maintained and always broken. This facility has substantially declined in the last few years as management has changed and the clientele demographic has shifted. In order to improve this gym, I would hire a new staff and management and focus on listening to what the members have to say when they express concerns. Also being proactive when it comes to maintaining equipment and keeping the facility clean and tidy so no one gets hurt."
328,2492397,2017-05-25,4,"There’s a lot of equipment and the set up of equipment is great. Everything is easy to access. I also like that they have a nice area for kids while I workout and I feel safe working out here because staff is helpful and friendly. It is well lit up and so the environment is always positive. The trainers are all very knowledgeable about the different types of machines and have valuable tips on different techniques. They also have a very nice basketball court and racket ball court. All in all there are so many things to do at this gym. But the equipment, pool, sauna and bathrooms can sometimes be very dirty at time which causes a bad odor. This happens a little too much and I think they should hire someone that specializes in just cleaning up the gym in these areas."
329,2492448,2017-05-24,4,"LA fitness staff was friendly and helpful. They took the time to work with me and how to start my fitness routine and regularly followed up to make sure I was comfortable and developing. At the time it was the closest to my home and the first gym I had ever been to. It was within walking distance so I never had an excuse not to go. However, I really disliked that men and woman took turns with the days we had access to the gym. It interrupted the routine I had wanted to do everyday. As much as they were charging only having access 3 days a week was rather annoying."
330,2473032,2017-05-24,3,"LA Fitness has a very wide variety of equipment and activities available to members, including basketball courts, racket, all dance studios and swimming pools, even a daycare facility. It was in a safe neighborhood, nice and well-lit with quality well-maintained equipment. It was also conveniently located to both my apartment and place of work. However, the sales tactics were very aggressive and misleading. The sales reps lied about the policies and signed my name for services which I did not agree to pay for which resulted in me leaving the gym permanently."
331,2492496,2017-05-24,5,"I like the gym’s location, its ambiance overall and the pool that they have which is big and spacious. The gym has complete equipments too and equipment that can't be found in other gyms. I also like that they have childcare present in the gym which is good for parents like me. The gym has good staff as well. Looking at everything and basing on my experience in the gym, there is nothing that I dislike about the gym except maybe that it's a little pricey but it's definitely worth it."
332,2492247,2017-05-24,3,"The location is really great for me and I think if I were traveling I might be able to find a LA Fitness in other larger areas... The facilities are clean and modern too. They have plenty of free weights and equipment. I tend to like a variety though and it is a bit lacking for non weightlifting things. While I get a good workout there, the locker room facilities are a little bit less than what I'd want. If there's a family only locker area (for kids) that would be good too. Would also like indoor swimming and more basketball courts."
333,2473092,2017-05-24,5,LA Fitness met my expectations. They went above and beyond their duties to ensure all my needs were met. If they were busy they politely spoke to you and came to help you as soon as they could. I was really impressed at the amount of time the workers spend with you. They are very understanding and compassionate about your needs. They take their time to explain the equipment to you and how it works to ensure that you would use the equipment safely. If you had any problems they were more than eager to help you understand how to use the equipment in case you felt you were doing it wrong. They also explain what equipment you need to use to get the results you are looking for.
334,2492304,2017-05-24,4,"I like the location and availability. The gym is close to home and there is ample parking. Accepts my insurance and it's a signature club, so they also provide towels, which I love. Also, prices are good and the club is always clean. They offer a lot of classes that I take, particularly Zumba, which is my preferred method of cardio. The management team takes good care of the facility, I appreciate that the staff are always friendly and the locker rooms are large and well kept."
335,2472876,2017-05-24,5,"I very much like LA Fitness. It's wonderful and affordable for me. My experience was very nice and chill. I loved the teachers and their attitude. The trainers were very well organized, helpful and laid back with me. They helped me with my goals throughout the process! The gym is affordable and they even got their own room for Zumba, and the classes are very well taught. I like their treadmills and also the pool which is good for practicing swimming in the winter because it is heated. I love swimming in the winter as well, less busy and people since it's mostly packed in the summer."
336,2473140,2017-05-24,4,"The gyms are great because of the late nights working out. They had a plan I could enjoy. When I can go there, submit my income and they give me a price that I can pay is what is great. When I go there, I can always find a new machine or open machine to use, but sometimes when working out, I have had a few machines quit working which is bad because I'm on a strict plan. I dislike the people that join also. Some of the people that join the gym tend to be more snobby than joining other gyms. Overall, this gym has showed me the everything that you could ask for in a finding a gym and they always have very comfortable towels to use afterwards. I would recommend this place to anyone."
337,2492352,2017-05-24,4,"It's the closest to my house and it has a good price. Easy access, enough of parking space, close to my favorite grocery store so I can go shopping after without making an extra trip. I like the schedule of the classes. A lot classes to choose from. Flexible schedule, friendly staff. Clean spacious room, many equipments, no lines to get one. Big and safe dressing room. However gym opens too late on weekends days. I would prefer to go there as early as possible since I am a early bird. Also, better wifi. The area with mirrors was taken for personal training too."
338,2472936,2017-05-24,4,"It's the closest, many local locations and many, many, exercise equipment, weights, scales. Yoga. Pilates, sexy women, sexy men. I'm in love with this gym. It's efficient and I like that it's open 24 hours, help if needed, support groups. People who are looking for a change in their appearance, everyone is out for something different and it's very inspiring. However, I wish there was a way to reserve a more private workout area. There are too many critics. It's not helpful and I feel like a loser, I'm so fat. It doesn't help me feel secure, I am very self conscious."
339,2492400,2017-05-24,5,"I love the gym. They have all of the equipment that I like exercising with and the gym is never overcrowded. Also the staff is always very friendly everytime that me and my family and friends go there and we always feel very welcomed each time we go. They are awesome and should keep doing exactly what they are doing. I chose this gym over others because of the location and I don’t have to worry about anything when I go there, they are really amazing. There is no gym that I would rather go to than LA Fitness."
340,2492451,2017-05-23,4,"I like many things about LA fitness, mostly how knowledgeable their staff is. They are always friendly, helpful and answer all the questions I might have. They also take very good care of the equipment and restrooms. Every time I have been there it is clean. However, sometimes there seems to be more people on treadmills, and I have to wait till one opens, which makes it take longer. The other members sometimes take a really long time. Maybe they should get more machines or limit the amount of time people can use them. An hour should be more than enough time. Other than that everything there is good. The gym has met my expectations. The place is nice and clean every time I'm there."
341,2472999,2017-05-23,4,"I chose my current gym over other gyms for the following reasons: location (there are tons of locations no matter where I am), pricing (the monthly cost is reasonable), my friends and family belong to my current gym, they have tanning beds and a sauna for me to relax when I'm done working out. The things that I like at my current gym include: location (there is one by my house and by my work) friendly staff, non-judgement zone, contests with weight loss prices, membership price. The features I dislike or wish to improve at my current gym are: updates equipment, long hours at night, more group exercise classes, more personal training staff, inputting a pool would be great."
342,2473047,2017-05-23,5,"I chose this gym over many others because of the value of everything you get for your money. I also really like the cardio cinema. Lastly, I like that Group fitness classes are included in your membership and available at the gym. I also like that the gym has a separate area and floor for cardio equipment and for weights. The only improvement I would make of the gym is that personal training would not be so expensive and that all classes would be included in your membership. Besides that, the upkeep of the gym was phenomenal. The appointment to choose from also had a great selection."
343,2492250,2017-05-23,3,"A family member had a membership at LA fitness with a great price incentive for additional family members. It was only $20 extra a month. I like the convenience and competence of their childcare facilities, the group fitness classes, the women's gym and the sufficient equipment options. The group fitness schedule and childcare schedule were also plusses. On the other hand, I once used a defective treadmill in the women's gym, and it was a scary experience. Additionally, on one of my first days working out, I needed assistance with an equipment inquiry, but the staff was inattentive and apathetic. Also, an instructor in one of the group fitness classes was a real **."
344,2492559,2017-05-23,4,"I went to this gym for a few years and I've always liked this gym. I also like how they have mirrors set up in some spots so you can see yourself as you exercise and to make sure you are doing it right! But I dislike the setup they have for changing areas, they should have it a little more of a private set up for people with self-esteem issues. I for one would rather get dressed or shower alone rather than next to a person I don't know. I think curtains should go up for people who want them. The changing areas could use a update if they haven't gotten one yet. Other than that I have had no issues with this place and would go back."
345,2492307,2017-05-23,5,"The gym has friendly staff and good equipment. Every time I go to the gym, the staff are willing to help me learn how to use the equipment, and most of the classes are really good. It is open at the hours I want and it is close to my house. But I'd like it to have more of the kind of equipment I usually use like the elliptical because they are always busy and people stand in line for a long time to use them. I'd like more sets of lighter weights because I can't find the ones I need. Plus, I would like the juice bar to have more of the snacks I like. Overall, the gym has met most of my expectations."
346,2473107,2017-05-23,5,"I absolutely love the fact that LA Fitness is a 24-hour gym and they have excellent customer service. Anytime you need something there is always someone around or someone to answer any questions. I love the service and staff. They are always friendly, never have attitudes and always willing to help with a smile on their face. The gym also has great equipment. I mostly use the treadmill, stair climber and the ab exerciser and everything always works."
347,2492355,2017-05-23,5,"I chose LA Fitness over other gyms closer to me for several reasons. They offer great specials to become a member, I don't feel like I'm being hassled when I'm going in there, and the variety of things it has to offer. Also, I like that it is large and that there is a great variety of equipment to use. I also like that it offers a variety of classes I can join and there are many people around that can offer assistance if I need anything. There are many gyms I could join that are much more convenient location wise, but I love LA Fitness. And even though the location I go to is not too far from me, I wish they would open a location in New Smyrna Beach or Edgewater, Florida, so that I would be able to go more often than just on the weekends."
348,2473155,2017-05-23,4,"LA Fitness has met my expectations by offering so many varieties of exercise classes, equipment, convenient hours, competitive gym fees and nearby locations. It is not often that gyms offer as many features as LA fitness without being extremely expensive. But some locations are not as clean as others, and staff is not always friendly or professional depending upon the location. This is a huge disappointment because I would expect the quality of professionalism and cleanliness to be universal throughout this franchise."
349,2472903,2017-05-23,5,"LA fitness met all of my expectations and I really love all it has to offer. I love all the equipment, the ellipticals are the best! There is plenty of treadmills and other equipment you can use. I also love the atmosphere and how nice the gym is. Sometimes people leave the weights on the wrong racks but it's not the gym's fault. I do wish it was open later and if it were open 24/7 it would definitely become my favorite gym. It would be more accommodating to my schedule. It would also be nice if they added fitness classes like Zumba or kickboxing."
350,2492403,2017-05-23,4,"I like that LA Fitness was a large venue with a lot of equipment to choose from. They also offered a great friends and family plan for a great price and it played a large factor in where I chose to go. I loved attending classes including Zumba, yoga, water aerobics, and cycling. I also enjoyed that there was a spacious locker room and a nice space for stretching or yoga. The pool was also a nice size and could accommodate large classes. But I did wish there had been more Zumba classes in the mornings because majority of the time they were only offered in the evening. The cycling classes were also offered at inconvenient times."
351,2472951,2017-05-23,4,They are great people and always look to provide the best experience possible. Not every gym is that way tryst. It is a great gym. Overall the equipment is great and the overall quality is phenomenal. I prefer the other way around because its the best place here in my town. LA fitness is like my second home. It has lots to do. If I could pick anything I to improve it would be lower prices.
352,2492454,2017-05-22,4,"My significant other has been going to LA Fitness for a while and I was hesitant to go until they told me about the sauna. I went in with them as a guest and I love it. I like that there is a sauna in LA Fitness. If my body is too sore or I'm feeling too lazy I can just sit in there for an hour and sweat everything out. Plus, it's closer to home and has everything I could think of. However, I would like there to be a bit more spacing between the equipment. I caught the sweat of the person working out next to me in my mouth and it was super gross. I now make sure I'm at least two machines away from another person."
353,2473005,2017-05-22,5,"I chose this gym because it is close by to the location in which I live, and the gym itself is amazing. It exceeds my expectations for a gym, and it also exceeds the abilities of other nearby gyms I have been to. LA Fitness has many positives about it, including the staff and its variety. The staff are incredibly friendly, and are always willing to help. Also, the staff never seems as if they're in a bad mood. The LA Fitness weight machines and free weights are incredibly varied, both in weight level and exercise type for different muscles. But, I would very much prefer if there was free water or towels to support the clients. Also, the gym is a little dirty, as people tend to leave things around and the staff doesn't get to it too quickly. The trash eventually becomes a little uncomfortable to be around, but not in any way unbearable. Overall, I prefer LA Fitness over any other gym I have visited."
354,2492502,2017-05-22,5,"I love the atmosphere, equipment, and the cleanliness at LA Fitness. It is close to home and extremely convenient for me whether I am coming from home or work. I like the way I'm treated at LA Fitness and no one bothers me. The gym meets every single need of mine and I love the ability to go when I like. My friends meet me there where we have a planned workout."
355,2492253,2017-05-22,5,"I like the racquetball court, lots of equipment, sauna and basketball court, and personal trainers. Also punching bags and classes. It is close in proximity and my entire family as well as many friends exercise there. I also think they offer very fair prices. I wish they would allow people to borrow equipment like racquets or MMA or boxing gloves."
356,2473053,2017-05-22,1,"I like that on some days it's only women. I love the hot tub, the smoothie bar and the price I pay. It's always clean and it located close to my home. I can go all times of the day or night and I feel safe. It has well lit parking lot. Just need security to walk you out. That would make it even better for the women and more equipment. I don't like that they always run out of fresh towels and I was told a lie to get me to sign a lifetime membership contract when I was 22 years old and it was overpriced at the time. I'm now 45. I didn't get any of the things I signed up for. No instructor to show me how to use equipment correctly and no weekly weigh in. Would love to switch but it's paid for. Got bill every two weeks and it was only suppose to bill me once a month so I'm not happy."
357,2492562,2017-05-22,5,I like the swimming pool and all the classes they have with the rooms because you feel like they actually want to help you become or stay fit and they have lots of features that make different exercising a lot of fun. But sometimes it's too crowded because there are a lot of different features that attract a lot of people which annoys me and makes it kinda hard.
358,2473113,2017-05-22,5,"LA Fitness has enough space to work out, variety of classes, and newer equipments. They also have a really nice water fountain that makes it easy to fill my bottle without getting germy. I chose this gym because of the proximity to my home, types of classes offered, good equipment, and the times of classes that are more convenient to my schedule. The childcare at LA fitness is great. We were at another gym then, but the childcare facility was gross. What I dislike is the volume of other people at the gym, it gets pretty muggy from the extra body heat. I would like if they were able to add more classes during the daytime, but they probably wouldn't have enough people to go to them so it's fine."
359,2492358,2017-05-22,3,"I liked the pool, how large the space was and the variety of activities. They used a lot of state of the art machines and I really liked the possibility of diversity in the activities you could take part in. But I no longer attend this gym due to membership cost. The cost was overwhelming and basic and did not give you much. I need help with my workouts but didn't get that with my membership. I am new to proper exercise and needed a coach. Membership should include all classes and bimonthly check in with a personal trainer. Overall the gym did not meet my expectations due to cost versus service. However if funds were not the issue the gym could have been very satisfying, I just don't have the expendable income to do so."
360,2473161,2017-05-22,5,I chose this gym because it is very close to my house. It is very diverse when it comes to workout classes and machines. I really like it and the trainers are very helpful and really motivate me to work hard and achieve my weight-loss goals. The trainers along with the various type of workout classes are excellent and the gym's price rate is also very reasonable. The gym is wonderful and I really enjoy being a member.
361,2472909,2017-05-22,4,"I was brought on a invite pass from a friend to start off, liked it and got my own and started to go regularly for some time. Though I've gotten lazy and haven't gone in a while and really not even sure if that LA Fitness is still in that same location. It was very clean and plenty of equipment so no waiting for whatever you wanted to use. Unlike smaller gyms where people tend to linger around one piece of exercise equipment for long periods of time, making it acceptable especially when multiple friends. I like privacy but in a gym, it's pretty much not achievable, mainly in showers/dressing rooms. I'd like to not feel odd when bringing my girlfriend's boy as he is 13 and tends to want to hide, which is understandable. Also not to have to cross paths with another man's situations."
362,2492406,2017-05-22,3,"We chose LA fitness because we weren't aware of any other gyms in our area with enough amenities that we could try different things out and find out what we liked. We considered the YMCA but LA fitness was much cleaner. Another factor was the convenient location and the fact that we could access gyms in different cities. I like the variety of weight machines, great for targeting specific areas in ways you can't do at home. I also like the racquetball courts, the hot tub and the sauna, the pool, nice clean locker rooms, lots of machines available and classes. On the other hand, I don't like the limited hours the location near me is open, it is a drawback, and the reason I don't go there anymore. Obviously it would be nice if it were not so expensive. Also I wish there was more seclusion when working on certain machines."
363,2472957,2017-05-22,4,There are many features that I like about the gym. First of all it looks nice both interior and exterior. There are many machines to exercise from and plenty of dumbbells. The pool is clean and nice. I chose this gym over other gyms because the building is formal and the workers there are friendly. But there are a few things that I dislike about the gym. One is that the monthly costs are too expensive. I would improve cleaning in the gym as well. So many people come in and out causing germs to spread. I don't want anyone to get sick from these germs so it would be nice if sanitation improved in the gyms.
364,2472969,2017-05-21,5,"In LA Fitness, there is a large variety of very nice and modern machines ready at your disposal. Also, you can use a plethora of other amenities that can help you with said exercises. The staff is very kind and are always there when you have any questions that need to be answered. If there was something that I would improve in this gym it would be making the music in the gym a little more appealing. The majority of times, it is rather boring and does not get me pumped. I would use personal headphones but, they're a distracting to me when i'm working out. Aside from that, LA Fitness is perfect for working out. It has everything a regular gym should have and more, plus it's at a rather cheap price. Overall L.A fitness is the superior gym. Other gyms seem inferior and not as serious. I have yet to see a gym that's at the level of L.A fitness."
365,2473017,2017-05-21,5,"I love almost everything about LA Fitness. I chose this gym mostly because of its amenities and wide range of locations. I like that it has locker rooms, a steam room, a pool, and showers. All of these amenities are very helpful when finishing a workout or to help with my workout in general. I don't think any other gym can compare to LA Fitness. Most local gyms in my area do not offer a steam room, and they charge to use the locker room, whereas LA Fitness has free locker rooms available to the public. It's difficult to describe to what I dislike. I guess the only thing I could say that I dislike that it is too popular. I don't think popularity or brand awareness is a bad thing. However in this case, popularity is the main cause of overcrowding sometimes. Another thing I would to see is possibly adding a small restaurant or food stand in every gym. Having a healthy and readily available meal option would be great after a long workout."
366,2473068,2017-05-21,5,I chose LA fitness over others because it was close to my house. Also I enjoy working out with friends and this happened to be the gym that my friends went to as well so it was good for me for both reasons. I like that when I am on the treadmill that there are screens to watch so you don't get bored while working out. Also I enjoy the open floor area where you may lay down mats to do other exercises you cannot do in a machine. Lastly I like the labeled dumbbell rack so everyone knows where each dumbbell belongs. I would like if the equipment was cleaned more often and if there was more music going on inside the gym. Also I think it would be nice if there were duplicates of certain machines that many people use.
367,2472846,2017-05-21,5,"LA fitness was having a promotional event for employees of the surrounding businesses. A rep brought in a flyer for a two week trial. I kept going because the amenities were great for the price and it was a comfortable environment. There were very clean locker rooms and exercise areas. The variety of equipment made working out fun. There were so many classes to choose from and an extremely friendly staff. This was the very best gym I have ever tried in 20 years and I truly wish the area I moved to had them. If there was one, I'd join again in a heartbeat."
368,2473125,2017-05-21,2,"The reason I chose LA fitness is because of the multiple convenient locations as well as, having friends who were members. The features I like are the hours which are accommodating, a large selection of different machines and classes. I also liked that they provide lockers and they have a large selection of free weights. I also liked that LA Fitness does not require a contract and will allow one to pay on a month to month basis. I also liked that LA Fitness provided one session with a personal trainer for free. This feature was very helpful for me since I have one thigh that is an inch bigger than the other and the trainer provided tips on how to make my upper thighs symmetrical. I like to work out on free weights and I dislike it when men often act frustrated or comment when I enter that section of the gym. Also, I do not like a lot of the polyurethane smells like sweat which is very noticeable when you are doing an exercise which requires you to lie face down on a bench, there are numerous members that do not wipe down the equipment once they finish exercising necessitating that I wipe down both before and after exercising. There is also often a wait for machines, the 30 minute policy on the treadmills, etc. are not reinforced at all. The same people are on the machines when I arrive and when I leave. If you have questions the staff is inaccessible and don't seem to care."
369,2473173,2017-05-21,4,"When I signed, the price was acceptable. It was spacious and contemporary. It's in Legacy Village, great location. I like having a walk there after good exercise or yoga class. Have nice stuff, plus free Zumba and yoga. The bathrooms are clean and the layout in whole is smart. I liked skylights and different equipment, but several of my favorite equipment is broken and gone. Also, there is no woman steam sauna and hot sauna is barely warm. They are showing same movies all the time, that became annoying, and there are no more variety of TV channels. I used to watch funny movies when working out, it would make me work out more."
370,2472921,2017-05-21,4,"This gym was close to my place of employment and close to my home (the one where my wife and kids live). That makes it easy to go to whenever I want to work out at the gym. I enjoy a lot of the features at the gym. For one, it is a very clean and tidy environment. Everyone is nice and pleasant to deal with and very attractive. Attractive people, mostly women, are the highlight of my day. When I go there it makes me happy to be seen with them."
371,2448114,2017-05-20,1,"I am extremely displeased with the way LA Fitness treat their 1st time customers. I joined but had no clue on how to properly work out or utilize their equipment. I decided to inquire about hiring a personal trainer so I sat down with one of the reps who keep in mind looks like he is high on some type of drug but this is who customer service had me sit down with to ""explain"" how it works. The rep starts talking really fast about all the different packages he can offer me and the one thing I clearly remember stating was that I don't want to pay any additional monthly payments besides the 35.00 a month for the regular membership I just purchased a few days prior. He said, ""Don't worry I got you. All you have to is pay a one time fee today for 400.00 to begin and I'm giving you 30 sessions. You can use them how you like whenever you like."" The lies he told... to get me to pay and I did so right then and there. SMFH. He said, ""Go look around and get on a few machines"" and I am looking like ""by myself?"" I don't know where to start. Long story short I went and walked into a boot camp class and hurt myself to the point where I couldn't walk straight for 3 whole days. A few days later I meet with my trainer who also didn't properly explain things to me because Eddie the idiot that signed me up didn't put any notes in my account. I not understanding what my contract consists of because Eddie never once gave me one because his printer ran out of ""paper"". I'm thinking 30 sessions at 400 is not bad. I can learn the ropes then do it on my own and get this weight off me. They fooled me, 260.00 was being taken out of my account for two months for a trainer monthly fee that I never agreed to. OMG. I went in person to speak with the manager and he totally brushed me off and said, ""You signed it. You own it"" then look me dead in my eyes and said, ""I'm off and I gotta go."" I called around to different departments and no one was able to help me to stop these withdrawals of 260.00 out of my account. I finally get the members service number and the rep said, ""You cannot get out of contract just like that, you have to pay us 50.00 your remaining balance at 1300 dollars."" This is so not fair. I have to pay out for services I will not be utilizing because it would be cancelled from that point on. So now being forced to stay in a contract I did not sign up for because the rep was so greedy to make that sale that he told me a bunch of lies just to get it. I feel violated and I'm still being robbed without a gun."
372,2472975,2017-05-20,3,"I live near a couple of the location so LA Fitness is a convenient choice with ease of access and use. Also, I chose this gym due to having friends that use it. They also have friendly and helpful staff, the workout machines are frequently available and the gym is clean and professional. However, I am not a fan of the overall cost or the plans to start up and the direct payment option did not work well."
373,2473023,2017-05-20,4,"I chose this gym as it was the closest to my home. Also I had friends going there. Had good reviews and no negative reviews. My friends liked the trainers and what was offered beyond weights. Lots of weights to use and lots of machines so there is no waiting. They have friendly staff that are helpful but not too pushy. It has large, open space. Good clean locker room and well lit so no problems at all. But sometimes the gym is too crowded. They need to have better time for use of the basketball courts. The courts are not open enough for free shooting. Games are always being played."
374,2473080,2017-05-20,5,"The gym was conveniently close, a walking distance to where I lived, was open 24 hours so I could use it at any time, nice for people who like to go late at night or early in the morning xD. After I tried it it just worked and was easy. It has met my expectations, but a sauna would be nice or a pool. The gym was always clean and had a lot of cool, relatively new equipment. It made for a good and easy experience. I've never really gone to another gym but I'd be open to try other gyms close to home."
375,2472858,2017-05-20,4,"LA Fitness has lots of equipment available to use, good variety of machines and exercise equipment, variety of things to do while there, good size gym, and helpful employees. Price was reasonable. It was recommended by a friend of mine. She had been going there and I went with her and liked it so I joined for a while. It met my expectations and I was pleased by the feeling of the gym. I only hope for the gym will be open more hours, have better atmosphere, bigger lockers and locker rooms, and more knowledgeable staff. Also, more trainers and appointments should be available, more fitness classes options and times."
376,2473131,2017-05-20,3,"There is nice atmosphere here. I like it very much. I feel that overall, I get my workout done nicely. With other gyms, there are too many features to a point where people go to other gyms to have fun and not to focus on their exercise. Cost is reasonable also. They make sure that I am having a good time. There are trainers too. I'm having a blast here with my gym. Everything is just great. The place is usually quiet so there is enough time to concentrate and focus on my workout. This is the best features that this gym had to offer. The place is literally one of the best. However, the place should be bigger with more equipment to work with. I feel like sometimes there's not enough features to go by. Therefore, I don't have too much to do."
377,2472927,2017-05-20,4,"I have heard good reviews from family and friends and it is advertised very well. It seems less intimidating than a majority of other gyms I've been to. They also have very good and clean equipment. I like that I can go at any time because I have a very busy schedule and need as much incentive as possible to go. However, it is a bit too expensive for me to go consistently. Also, the nearest gym near me is a 10 minute drive and I would prefer to be able to walk or ride my bike."
378,2472981,2017-05-19,2,Really only went a couple of days. Had a friend talk me into it. It wasn't for me. I liked the gym but I just felt uncomfortable. When I visited I didn't feel welcome. I probably should have given it a bit more of a chance. Great equipment though. It seemed they had great group classes. Loved the sauna. It also has a great location in the Southside. If I ever go to a gym again I really will need one with a swimming pool. I also think I would like one closer to home. It was an experience though.
379,2473029,2017-05-19,5,"LA Fitness is within walking distance from my house and it is nicer looking than other gyms which is important to me. I really enjoy the smoothie/health cafe in the gym to use before or after working out. It’s very clean and the atmosphere is good with music playing in the background. There is also a sauna and a nice locker room. I also like the customer service that the employees provide to the patrons. Overall, it met my expectations. But I wish the operating hours were longer and they had a tanning bed in the building."
380,2473089,2017-05-19,5,I chose this gym because my sister and friends went. I liked it right away and haven't felt the need to look elsewhere. The price is fair and the equipment is excellent. They more than met all my expectations. I like the positive and friendly environment and the wide range of equipment. The people working out are focused and nonjudgmental and the workers are helpful and knowledgeable. I really loved the gym. Sometimes it can get a bit crowded but it has never been a big issue. Overall it is a gym I would recommend if you want a friendly place to work out on state of the art equipment.
381,2472870,2017-05-19,3,LA Fitness is good. They have good equipment that was newer and clean. Good shower area and access to the equipment. They offered classes and personal coaches. Good hours that they were open and a pretty good group of people who regularly went. But it was kind of expensive and with me no longer consistently going it no longer justified the cost. I would have liked to have seen more updated equipment in the treadmills and machines though. It would be nice if there were an indoor or an outdoor swimming pool or possibly a basketball court and tennis courts and racquetball courts. It did seem to have everything that I first wanted but then I started to see the things that I was missing and wish that they had.
382,2473137,2017-05-19,3,"The gym is close to home so it's easy to go to every day if I want to and the hours meet my needs. There is a lot to do any day and makes working out easy. The friendly staff, large lockers, snack area, pool, TV, wifi, weights, sauna, hot tub, racquetball, kick bags, and fitness classes all are factors that make it nice. However, the floor is cold, the shower area doesn't have a place to dress right by the shower, the tile is really outdated, the spray is not very good and the water isn't very hot. It also needs chairs and somewhere to put your towel."
383,2472933,2017-05-19,4,"The gym has a large open space, is well lit and the bathrooms are clean most of the time. Membership isn't very expensive so that is also a plus. There are many of these gyms in my area. For the relatively low membership fees I pay, it meets my expectations though it's not incredibly amazing. It has a wide variety of equipment I can work with, if they are working. Many of the machines there are out of service and the gym is usually very packed and shady. Sometimes it could be in cleaner condition, but there are a lot of people here so I guess it is hard to maintain."
384,2472987,2017-05-18,5,"I got a good deal on joining the gym, so I like the quality I receive for the price. It has met my expectations by being clean and well maintained. It is rarely too crowded. I enjoy using the sauna and pool facilities. I enjoy the group classes which have a nice variety and good equipment. And there is a smoothie shop. However, I would improve the stretching area to make it bigger and I wish that it had longer hours, especially on Sunday. Also, customer service and friendliness from the staff could be better. But overall, positive gym exercise experience"
385,2473035,2017-05-18,4,"LA Fitness is nearby and I can jog there. There is a huge variety on what to do because there are a lot of machines that focuses on the different parts of the body. There are classes offered based on what we want to work out on that day: cardio, arms, yoga. I would like to do a class everyday such as Zumba but the classes are very limited. There is also a little daycare center for children so you can go to the gym without worrying plus a free trial pass for family or friends for them to try out before purchasing the year pass which is great. If someone forgot to bring their drink along, there is a vending machine and a water fountain. Also, it's very sanitary and a bit wider compared to other gyms. However, there needs to be more space. It gets very crowded, cramped, sweaty and smelly after a while so I would like to improve the ventilation as well as WiFi for me to use and listen to my music or at least better signal so I can use mobile data."
386,2473095,2017-05-18,5,"It's the place which motivates me to work out to keep my mind and body healthy. I love these people, they are totally awesome. Great place with perfect staff and attitude, great people to work with and achieve the goal of my fitness, great service and excellent customer support. It's a mesmerizing place. It's the perfect gym for me as it is very convenient and easy. It's also the place I like to spent much of my time. Here I can take my children and they love it too."
387,2472882,2017-05-18,5,"I like the gym’s cleanliness, the fact you can try a personal trainer before you get one, that there's a sauna, a pool, very nice locker room, and that you can also buy food and drink from a stand type thing. The staff is extremely helpful too. The gym is very well organized and it's a very great place to work out. I chose it because I knew it had the equipment I wanted. It has exceeded my expectations and now, any other gym that I go to will have to be up to LA Fitness standards."
388,2473143,2017-05-18,3,"There's poor equipment at my location and staff could be rude or flat out ignore you. It was the only gym by me for a while, so it could get very packed at inconvenient times, but the location was convenient. It was close by my house and along the route I took daily. They offer free group classes and late hours. It met my expectations for the costs. It was cheap with amenities I needed and they offered discounts for childcare and personal training, which are inexpensive."
389,2472939,2017-05-18,4,"I chose this gym over other gyms that I could've chosen instead of this one because my friends recommended it and also my family recommended it and since my friends and family recommended it I assumed it was a good gym. It's very big and inclusive and the people in there don't judge you if you're bigger or out of shape which is nice because I want to exercise without being judged by people who are more fit than me. However, sometimes the gym smells because there's a lot of sweat which obviously makes it smell because of the sweat from everyone there and not a lot of air circulation which makes it smell."
390,2472990,2017-05-17,5,"LA fitness is an awesome gym. Very clean. Keeps equipment up to date and has all the equipment you will need to keep in shape. The staff is very considerate, friendly, responsible and having a good time. They're right on spot with asking if you need anything and love everything about it. I would recommend this gym to anyone at any time. I wouldn't ever use another gym. This one meets all my needs in one place. Happy place and people and lovely trainors."
391,2473038,2017-05-17,3,I would rather work out at a smaller gym like when I’m at school but LA Fitness was closest to where I live. Sometimes I get overwhelmed or feel self-conscious in big corporation-type gyms. They are also very expensive for memberships so I only get there when I can go with friends as a guest or during promo offers that are given to me. Fitness classes like Zumba are what I enjoy most. When I work out with other people it makes it more fun and you can develop community. I don't particularly enjoy working out so when I have others to hold me accountable it keeps me motivated.
392,2473098,2017-05-17,4,"I chose this gym mainly because it's close location to my home. I usually would exercise outside but I needed to be indoors being that it was freezing outside in the winter. I loved that the pricing was very reasonable compared to other gyms close by. I also loved the hours and the cleanliness of the gym. I liked that the staff was very helpful if I needed it and they were knowledgeable about the equipment. The only thing that I wish was different would be that I wish we also had a pool other members of the gym more easily on location. I also wish more classes were offered so exercising would be more fun, and we could meet other members."
393,2473146,2017-05-17,3,"This gym has a pool and offers aquatic classes. The offer for lifetime membership at only 69 dollars a year was a big factor in why I chose this brand over others. It also has multiple location in which I can go to. They are reasonably priced, clean and open at times that I can go. They offer high impact classes for those who want them and have qualified trainers. However, I dislike the individual TVs at the machines like some of the gyms have. The machines could be more spaced out and more aquatic classes during the evening would be enjoyable so I would not have to rush from work to get there."
394,2472891,2017-05-17,5,"Often times I enjoy bringing in a friend with me to enjoy the experience and it becomes a very comfortable. There are a lot of accessories that come with this gym, also fun classes to take all year round with very pleasant people. I enjoy the pool, the different accessible locations of the gym, customer service and the fact that the memberships are affordable is a very popular gym with a lot of machines. There a lot of things to do in this gym and it has definitely met my expectations. However, I dislike that there's a lot of noise. There are a lot of people who visit each location and there is often not enough room. Sometimes during the classes they have, there is not enough one on one connection with instructor and student. Sometimes the dance instructors go too fast therefore I am unable to keep up with anyone in the class."
395,2472942,2017-05-17,3,I chose this gym because it's less than 5 mins from my house. I used to drive 10-15 mins to the other gym and this is much more convenient. My expectations are met for the gym. It does not exceed them though. The gym closest to my house is an old Bally's gym that was never fully renovated when LA Fitness bought them. So the building is outdated and should be updated to look like all the other LA Fitness gyms.
396,2472993,2017-05-16,5,"Elliptical bike, treadmill, weights, tanning beds were all stellar and made for a very good workout and I liked all the fitness classes they had there as well. Being able to go work out with other people that wanted to get in shape and tone up was very helpful because it kept me in a competitive mindset and I didn't feel the exhaustion kick in as much as trying to exercise alone at home. All the staff were polite and non-judgemental! I felt confident and comfortable there which is very important! I had friends to work out with there which made me feel comfortable and motivated as well. The other nice thing is they have multiple locations! I could work out on vacation or business trips! I was very satisfied with the gym, but each location could be bigger. That way they could accommodate more people all at once. I feel like sometimes I had to wait for certain exercises or equipment to become available which is frustrating if I have only a certain allotted time to do all the exercises I want to do. Also updating equipment would be nice to see at some locations as well! Plus not all the other members wipe down their equipment after they finish their workouts which for a germaphobe is like hell to see. But I really did like my time going there and would highly recommend it to others. I had a great experience each time I went to workout."
397,2473041,2017-05-16,4,"I enjoy exercising very much. I try to mix it up, mainly I love running outdoors, and add other cardio and weight training at the gym. La fitness has top notch state of the art equipment. La fitness has very convenient locations that work well with my personal and work schedules. They also have very friendly staff that go the extra mile to assist with my fitness needs. The only thing I would mention is that there is another customer who frequently comes in the same time that I do and leaves the equipment full of sweat and doesn't clean up after himself. This gets on my nerves and prevents me from having a good work out some days. I've reported this to the staff and they come and clean up but it was a persisting problem, but not to the point I won't come in for workouts. I will try to come in at different times to avoid this. Other than the other customer problems I mentioned, this gym has very much exceeded all of my expectations. The pricing for my current plan is a little higher than other options, but it's worth it for the convenience of the location, well trained and friendly staff members. I intend to renew my membership when it comes due in the next few months."
398,2473101,2017-05-16,4,"I like that my favorite LA Fitness has an indoor pool, all new equipment, a large variety of exercise equipment, and lots of classes to choose from. I also love that it's close to home and it recently opened, so they had a great promotion going on. The gym has met my expectations and it's a great value for the price. But I hate that I'm harassed by personal trainers trying to get you to sign up with them for one on one training sessions. I just want to be able to work out on my own and on my own pace."
399,2473149,2017-05-16,5,"This gym has exceeded my expectations in every sense. Not only does it have all the state of the art machines you can think of exercising, but as a whole it's really one of those gyms where every claim they seem to put out with regards to what they offer is very much legit. I like that there is always staff on hand, ahead of the curve machines and classes beyond belief (seriously at the one out here in Indy that I use there was TONS of classes). Also, like the general amenities, trainers that are easy to access if wanted/needed, and so on. It's really a gym that goes above and beyond in every capacity."
400,2472897,2017-05-16,4,"I chose that gym because it was convenient to get to from where I lived, I had friends that worked out there and they offered a lot of other stuff too. It also was very clean inside and everyone who worked there was very nice and helpful. It was never overcrowded and the hours were good for my schedule. However, I did not like the fact that you had to sign a contract and be committed to something rather you went or not. I also did not like that I thought it was too high priced, that the trainers cost too much money so I could not afford to hire one and there were no private places to get dressed in the shower room."
401,2472945,2017-05-16,2,"I only chose this gym because a friend went there and she talked me into joining to get in shape before my wedding. I liked the hours of operation, pricing options, and the options for equipment at the gym. The hours were convenient to my work schedule, and the staff was pleasant. However, I wish this gym included perks, such as tanning or training. I wasn't very knowledgeable on how to put together an effective workout, so some assistance would've been great. I didn't go very often when I was a member because the location was not convenient to make a regular trip. I didn't renew after my initial membership was expired."
402,2434596,2017-05-15,5,"The gym has a great reputation, the upkeep of its equipment is more than you can ask for, has showers. It is also clean, professionally run, upbeat, encouraging, and helps me meet my goals. I love all the different classes and the machines too. The class hours really work for me and the instructors are up to date on all their credentials. I wish there were women's only hours like Tue pm, Thur pm and Sat am just to MIX it up, or come up with a fun women's only challenge just to let us know you care about us."
403,2472966,2017-05-15,2,"The membership in LA Fitness is affordable and usually free machines. There is always parking but there are quite a few locations. Some of the trainers are ok but not very well trained and the front desk staff is often grumpy or preoccupied. The gym is not as well kept as it should be.I wish there were steam rooms and the changing rooms could be better. There are often people who go there to pick up women rather than work out. My expectations weren't high, but they weren't met. It's fine for what it is, but they have the finances to make it much better."
404,2473014,2017-05-15,2,"LA Fitness was nearby & had a special at the the time. I could basically stop there on my way home from work, so it wasn't too out of the way. I was pleased that it wasn't crowded especially since I would go at the typical busy time. There weren't an excess of obnoxious people at this location so that was nice. I liked the recumbent bikes & the weight machines. I liked that there was always parking & when I used it in the summer, there wasn't a wait for the bikes although they didn't have many. I like that there were book stands on the bike because reading motivated me to use the bike longer. However, the music was always too loud or it was music I didn't like. The staff was annoying especially when it came time to quit. They pulled the most intimidating muscle bound guy from the floor who took this stance like (frowning) ""Why do you want to quit? Grrr."" They were just kids, but annoying ones. The crowd there wasn't as bad as some other gyms but there were some of your typical types hanging around. Also it always stunk in there. Just nasty like old sweat. I never trusted that the machines were cleaned off & that gave me a really gross feeling regarding catching a cold, etc."
405,2434884,2017-05-15,5,"The hours of operation are perfect for my schedule, the staff is always very friendly, helpful kind and understanding. LA Fitness always has the best promotions and I really enjoy their policy of being able to bring a friend along to work out with you. Also they have the most up to date equipment, and always have personal trainers that are willing to help you with your goals during workout. They have very clean bathrooms with showers and lockers that you can bring your own lock and use to keep your possessions safe while you workout. And the workout floor and all the equipment is kept clean throughout the day. They have televisions all around that you can watch and use your own headphones to hear. This gym has met my expectations and some. I choose this gym over the others because I have been a member with LA fitness for over 5 years and I absolutely love it. I have the best time every time I go to workout. All the employees know me by name and they genuinely care. Everyone that works there is very passionate about health and fitness and rewards and congratulates people for the progress they make towards reaching their fitness goals. The only thing I dislike would be sometimes the bathrooms are a tad bit dirty and occasionally the other people working out at the time I go are rude or can be a bit abrasive. But overall it's a great place. And there are plenty of locations."
406,2473062,2017-05-15,3,"The gym was clean with good lighting. It had a good range of machines including the ones I wanted to use. However, the gym felt feminine and for those who were not as serious about lifting weights or general fitness. The gym was okay but could have had a better vibe with less after work quick exercise junkies, not so many more serious weight lifters. Proximity to location made it easiest to get to and parking lot had ample parking with easy access. Nice to see a variety of customers which makes things interesting."
407,2434695,2017-05-15,5,"A friend recommended me to LA Fitness so I went with her. I liked that they offer a variety of machines and classes and that it was close to my work. It had everything in a gym I was mostly looking for. I like the personal training you can get. It's a nice atmosphere and the staff is really helpful. The gym also has a great energetic vibe which is very motivating when working out at a gym. I can't think of much I would change, except maybe a bit cheaper would be nice as well as more water aerobics. I would also like to see a few more types of muscle building machines and better access to the locker rooms."
408,2434971,2017-05-15,2,"LA fitness gym has a juice bar, a child care center and is usually clean and well kept. The gym had a pool and a very nice women's locker room. However, the gym's hours of operation are sometimes not conducive to my schedule. Also, the classes offered could be better and have better instructors. The personal trainers did not seem very committed to their clients. Nevertheless, I chose this gym because it was brand new at the time, had a very good membership price and close to my home and my children's schools. I'd previously been a member of this gym on a different city so I was somewhat familiar with them."
409,2473122,2017-05-15,3,"I like the pool, the basketball court, and the fact that the gym provides classes in CrossFit and all the extras I get from the membership I pay for. A CrossFit class is usually $100.00 a month or more so I am happy with my membership. This make it a value to me. What I don't like is the time that I go the gym is always crowded so much so that I can't use equipment when I'm ready to use the equipment. It isn't fun waiting to get my workout in and there is a line to use the equipment."
410,2473170,2017-05-15,4,"There are many choices in gyms but LA Fitness stands out. I'm a military person so cost and fitness are very, very important to me. The gym is convenient and affordable with ample equipment so you don't have to wait to workout. It's very clean and friendly staff as well. I think with any gym the issue of locker room privacy is always a turnoff."
411,2472918,2017-05-15,4,"The location is convenient for me, the hours of operations works for me, it's close to my home and work. The employees are all nice and friendly. The salad bar has many options of healthy foods for you as well as delicious smoothies. I also like the dance and kickboxing classes, the variety of exercise equipment, the sauna, as well as the pool. There's also the indoor basketball as well as trainers are always available. However, some of the machines are not working, the carpet needs an update as well as the lockers, the location is kind of small, and it would be nice if they update the pool area. But it's overall a good experience."
412,2435043,2017-05-15,5,LA Fitness was recommended to me by a friend and I trust their opinion. I like the lap pool and the cardio area where I spend most of my time. They also have personal trainers and the juice bar is great for an after workout treat. It's been a wonderful experience so far.
413,2434791,2017-05-15,5,"I love LA Fitness and the people who work out in it. This gym makes me feel comfortable and capable of completing my workout goals. It always have what I need and want. The classes that they offer are good and you can take on various times and machines. Occasionally the classes I want to take are overcrowded as well as the room being a bit too cold. Also, the machines are not working at times when I want to use them."
414,2434608,2017-05-14,4,"The gym speaks to me in ways that I cannot even explain. The atmosphere overall is very pleasant and nice to be in especially with the people who try to help me out when I most need it. Also, what I love most about this gym is that it has a lot of equipment that I use and some equipment that I have never ever seen before. I use the rip cord for my core exercises as well as to tone my upper arms and chest. It has a friendly staff that is always on the move to help especially if there is any type of emergency that could arise. Also, their service in the drink bar is top notch and the way they make their smoothies are the best that I have ever tasted in my life."
415,2434887,2017-05-14,5,"I chose LA Fitness for the proximity. I like their basketball court which are nice since I love to play basketball. They also have a pool which is relaxing and I enjoy swimming. I also enjoy watching really hot chicks. It's a lot of fun. There should be more treadmills though. Sometimes when I've gone, it's been hard to get an open one. I would also like more viewing of the spinning classroom. There's really good looking women in there. But they're pretty good overall."
416,2434701,2017-05-14,5,"LA fitness is closer to my workplace so I don't have to drive a long way to get there. Also, my friends and colleagues go there as well, and it has met my expectations widely and would like to keep going there. I like the feel of it, the machines, the people, the trainers, everything. It's great and it was recommended by my colleagues who also work out there, so I don't feel lonely. It's great as it is, but if we're being picky, it'd be cool if they had a more varied juice bar and offered a bigger selection of snacks. It would also be useful if they had their own app."
417,2434977,2017-05-14,5,I like the variety of equipment in LA fitness gym and the way everything is sectioned off and grouped together. I feel like I can workout my whole entire body. It has a great payment plan and customer service is great. I feel like I can come there and get everything done.
418,2435046,2017-05-14,5,LA Fitness offers the most bang for my buck. There are lots of fun classes and machines for me to take advantage of. There is always something new and exciting. The staff is always pleasant to deal with and the machines are always available when I need them. I also love the spin classes. They help me to burn a lot of calories in a short period of time. But LA Fitness should lower their prices and add tanning beds to my location. Other locations have them but mine does not.
419,2434797,2017-05-14,5,"I use LA Fitness for its wonderful tennis court and amenities, including classes and spa services. I like doing the Zumba and yoga classes, as well as booming massages and waxing services. This gym exceeds my expectations in cleanliness, services, and amenities. I would recommend my gym to anyone. I would like it if there was a student discount especially for student athletes that practice there like me because its downside is the steep price. However, this is made up for in the high standards of service."
420,2434614,2017-05-13,5,"My friend told me about this gym and that he is very satisfied so I tried it out. When we took a trip to LA I made a test workout and it was good. It is cheap and offers good workouts. I also liked the services. They answered every question I had. I disliked maybe that it was very crowded, sucked a little."
421,2434893,2017-05-13,3,"I really enjoy that they have a large swimming area, a sauna, well-maintained machines, and really good member services. I enjoy the snacks as well. It's a great maintained place, updates and newer machines, TV's available to all member while on a machine, and it's decent. Other gyms are quite dirty and have really outdated machines. I feel as though there could be more classes offered to members. The price to me is slightly high. They do specials every now and then, but it's a lot of money if you paid full price. Also, I feel insecure most likes in there, and afraid to ask for help."
422,2434983,2017-05-13,4,"I want to have more step simulators. I want the entire gym to be in the mirrors to see if the exercise is being done correctly. In the pool, you need to make repairs. Near the Jacuzzi, tiles on the floor are all in cracks. I want to clean the halls where yoga and Zumba pass. Nonetheless, LA fitness gym is very close to the house, seven minutes by car. The hall is very pleasant, friendly, honest and sympathetic people. The room is very cozy and comfortable. There are no queues on the simulator as there are not enough people."
423,2435049,2017-05-13,5,"People I know go here at LA Fitness and we can work out together. Also, it's a very large gym with great hours. The people who work here are also very nice and helpful. I've heard nothing but great things so it made me want to join. You can go swimming or do cardio or strength exercises as well as classes. This is a fun gym but it is very expensive. At times, it’s worth it but other times, I could get a similar workout somewhere cheaper."
424,2434803,2017-05-13,1,"I like that there is childcare while you work out at LA Fitness. I also like the dry sauna and the pool was indoor. I chose this gym when it first opened because they initially offered me a good deal. The equipment was top of line and the faculty was very clean. But the employees, including the owner are money hungry, rude and don't care about providing good customer service. It's frustrating."
425,2434626,2017-05-12,5,"LA Fitness is the closest to my home and I exercise there regularly. It was recommended by my sister who is a personal trainer. I regularly attended Zumba and yoga classes and I enjoy it. The SilverSneakers are also great, I will participate in it. I plan to partake in the water aerobics during the summer months because I don't really like to get into the pool during the winter months. If there is no class going on during my visit, I will hop on the treadmill for an hour. It would be nice if there were more Zumba instructors. There are several instructors, but the recent turnover has been a little unsettling. The most recent hirees are just not as good as the girls I have been exercising with the past three years."
426,2434905,2017-05-12,5,"I have been a member of LA Fitness for almost 4 years. I love the broad selection when it comes to equipment and how helpful the staff and trainers are. Even if I haven't personally paid for a trainer, they are always there to answer my questions. I truly love everything about being a member at LA Fitness. However, it does cost a little more than I like paying and I don't like that it is over $30 to add a guest pass to your monthly membership. I chose LA Fitness due to the wide selection of equipment and its overall quality. Most gyms I've been to have a pool and sauna, and all that I have visited have several punching bags. I also appreciate how helpful the staff is."
427,2434716,2017-05-12,3,LA fitness was offering a special introductory price for three months so that I could test out to see if I really liked it. Usually most places offer only a week or month which never gives you long enough to really try it out to make an educated choice to join as a member. I like that there was always lots of choices in equipment. I also liked that there were lots of treadmills so that I never had to wait very long before getting on for my turn. I don't like that everything was so open in one large room instead of having different rooms for each type of exercising. It always felt like people were staring at me which made me feel really uncomfortable.
428,2434995,2017-05-12,3,"I normally like working out different areas and when I wasn't working out, I hit the pool or the sauna. Then to wind down I would also use the massage therapy as well as stress release and different activities. Overall, it was a pleasant activity. I really disliked how people didn't clean up after themselves that really annoyed and the personal trainers didn't focus on enforcing it. Maybe if they did a better job, I would still be a member. I was able to accomplish my workout goals and fulfil my health needs but now that I was able to complete my goals I no longer the gym membership maybe in the future. I will return if I lose my goals."
429,2435055,2017-05-12,3,"I like the fact that the gym has a quality childcare facility, the swimming pool, fitness classes that I can attend for free and juice bar and healthy snacks available. I also like all of the instructors' knowledge base and helpfulness, as well as the range of equipment for members. But I really dislike having to pay for extra classes, I do not feel comfortable with some of the childcare workers, the high membership costs and the pressure to renew."
430,2434812,2017-05-12,4,"LA Fitness was the gym my sister had a membership to so we would go together and work out. It met my expectations. Plus they have a daycare room for kids if you didn't have a sitter for. The one thing they can improve is the sign up cost plus the monthly fees. They were higher than I could keep up paying for. Plus the distance. I would create different pricing packaging. But the workers are very friendly and helpful. They also would show you how to use the equipment properly. It was a clean place, reasonably good hours, plus the different equipment they have."
431,2434824,2017-05-11,4,"The variety and scope of gym and exercise facilitating equipment at my gym in my local city and state is top notch and I like the classes that are offered. In my own personal opinion, if I was the owner, I would offer plenty and lots of different various discounts for current members of my gym in my city and state, especially for referrals. But I liked the price and the number of offerings."
432,2434638,2017-05-11,3,"Convenience location and provides the best results and offers other services that are helpful to stay healthy and gets advice and support regarding the workouts. A gym can offer a wide diversity of activities to improve flexibility, mobility, posture, strength and power as well as relaxation techniques. Gyms can provide an atmosphere conducive to a tough workout. However, the social ambiance of a particular gym is not suited to your personality (some gyms can be very cliquey). The gym is overcrowded at the times you can visit. A stifling environment as opposed to the open air spaces where you run. In some gyms there is a lack of supervision and it is difficult to obtain advice and support."
433,2434917,2017-05-11,5,"LA fitness is a really well known gym. I love all the equipment they have and the attention to the customer is kind and great. Also, the services they provide are on point with great teachers. I personally enjoy going there everyday and love meeting new people too. I actually made this my option because of being more economic than other gyms and location too. They have great economic plans if you don't want to go everyday."
434,2434731,2017-05-11,5,LA fitness is very close to my house and all the places I visit in my neighborhood and pretty much all of my friends and family go to the same gym as me! I really like everything about my gym. What I would say I like the most is the sauna rooms and I like swimming in the indoor pool and working out in the area where there are treadmills. I wish it was a little bit bigger than it already is.
435,2435007,2017-05-11,4,"I really like the Membership price. I love that they have different and varieties of packages that you may choose from. It is very affordable and they work with you every time you reapply for membership. Lockers are pretty roomy and cool. They seem to hold up all of my belongings safely. I really love yoga but cannot participate at all the times. I wish they had more classes that I can attend and participate in, maybe at my location specifically. I would also like staff to be more involved in customer needs. Cleanliness on equipment can also be better as well as locker rooms and showers. I believe that I would not go with any other location because it is very convenient and staff is super friendly and usually all equipment is available and up in running."
436,2435061,2017-05-11,5,"A lot of equipment. I have never seen that much. Everything is placed and easy to use. Spend as much as time as I want in there. Indoor pool and basketball court are awesome and are nice additions to this gym. But just to name a few, maybe the second floor to have more stuff besides stairs and treadmills. Also, wish that people would be more considerate of others waiting for a turn to use an equipment piece, and the locker rooms had more privacy and bigger. I dislike the colors too and not a huge fan of all the mirrors. But the gym has met my expectations. If they lowered the memberships down to a reasonable price they would bring more people in. I feel it is above other gyms and if it ever improves it would be guaranteed the best."
437,2419155,2017-05-10,1,"Do you like pushy ""used car salesmen"" staff surrounding you? Paying 2x, 3x, 4x the price of gyms in the same neighborhood? Being surrounded by roided dudes and fake women? If yes, LA Fitness is the place for you. I've frequented many gyms (small and commercial) across the nation and can honestly say that LA Fitness tends to do it wrong every time. Staff - In several locations, I found the staff very non-professional. The women were snap chatting in the front or flirting with just about anybody that would give them attention. The men are typically pacing back and forth in extra small polo shirts ranting about their qualification and expert level of knowledge from an online certification (you'll find most of them are in fact college drop-outs). The sum up the staff as a whole, think ""Jersey Shore"" meets ""The 3 Stooges"".Price - Sure they offer a wide array of fitness equipment, but you'll find there's always a list of several competitors within a mile or less that offer the same equipment at a fraction of LA's membership cost. Typical Gym Users - Do you ever find yourself getting annoyed with the ""done up"" chick that keep posting videos and photos on social media after her 7th enhancement surgery? How about the roided-out guy that is most likely managing a GNC store? Well both of these idiots are the norm for an LA Fitness.Pushy Sales - Even after you sign up, expect an excessive amount of phone calls about personal training - ""no bro, I pay you idiots 3x the membership of other gyms... I'm good."" Expect another call from the same guy 2 days later. Cancellation - Good luck with that. Even though you can sign up very easily in person, you can't cancel in person. This is in fact a BBB violation... Though most of the associates there are unaware with what ""BBB"" even means... ""look it up on your phone... bro!"" Do yourself a favor and research other gyms before signing up for this joke of a company. I do not see LA Fitness lasting long as they cross several legal/ethical lines frequently. Legal counsel, I'm looking at you."
438,2434836,2017-05-10,4,"My friends have recommended me this gym and I have heard a lot of good things about this gym, I went inside with a lot of expectations and another reason why I chose this gym is because I have one near where I live. They have a sauna and pool, they are very nice and relaxed. The staff are professional and very friendly towards people, they always have many activities and a wide variety of equipment. However, Sometimes I don't like the atmosphere in this gym, it is usually almost always crowded and the people that use this gym are snobby and often rude at times."
439,2434650,2017-05-10,2,"LA Fitness has many choices of equipment, variety of machines, flexible open hours and clean equipment maintained in good condition most of the time. It was also less expensive than others and was located at a convenient place. I had friends who joined the same gym. But it is crowded at peak times and staff unavailable for problem resolution. Parking is almost always an issue and each location differs from each other in equipment and cleanliness. It is also hard to use the proper equipment at peak hours."
440,2434926,2017-05-10,4,"LA Fitness has an extensive floor plan with all the different equipment that you could hope for. Free weights. Treadmills. Ellipticals. A swimming pool. All that and many classes that you can sign up for too. The amenities are top notch too which keep me coming back. Also, it's very convenient and I know 2 or 3 people who belong to the gym as well and can get in a workout with me. I would like it if they would make it a little more exclusive so that there aren't so many people there during what I would consider peak hours of the day. Many of them are using free passes or friend's passes."
441,2434743,2017-05-10,5,"I'm very picky when it comes to gyms. I've gone and tried numerous gyms, Life Time Fitness is my absolute favorite, but it's unfortunately too expensive. I love that LA fitness has child care, a huge range of equipment, and all the classes you can take. I also like that they have women's workout rooms so that it’s nice if you are uncomfortable working out with others. But I dislike that LA fitness has a cafe with food in the gym. I don't want to work out and then smell and see food. Also, the employees are on their phones a lot instead of working and they are kind of smelly and dirty. I wish they kept up on cleaning a little better."
442,2435019,2017-05-10,5,"I love all of the amenities that LA Fitness provides. Things like basketball courts, racket ball areas, a pool, great machines are things look for in a gym. The only things I can think of that I don't necessarily like about LA Fitness are how crammed in you can feel due to the volume of machines, and how busy it gets at peak hours of the day. LA Fitness has met my expectations to their fullest extent. I am able to go at rough hours during the day, usually right around noon during my lunch break, and do nearly any workouts I would like."
443,2435073,2017-05-09,3,"I went to LA fitness as a guest. I was invited on a 10-day pass. The facility was clean and the reception was curious. They have a great variety of machines to use to workout on. The atmosphere did not smell like a locker room and has substantial privacy in locker/restroom. I really enjoyed the sauna. On the other hand, I went for the first time and found the jacuzzi was filthy. Yuck! Went back 5 days later, still the same. If it was not functioning properly, there should be a notice to inform clients not to use it... people were in it!!! The staff should be more attentive to equipment failure. If this was my very first time alone at a gym would like an escort to demonstrate the use of equipment. Equipment is not always easy for me to use. Would be nice to have a shorter check on you while going thru this experience for the first time at the facility."
444,2434848,2017-05-09,5,"LA Fitness allows members to bring guests with them whenever they visit the gym. This makes it very convenient for me to bring friends to work out with. It also made it so I was able to check out the facility before committing to the monthly fees. This particular gym just opened up recently in my area so all of the facilities are very nice, new and affordable but I wish there was more room for me to lift my weights without being in anyone else's way. Sometimes it can get a bit crowded."
445,2434659,2017-05-09,3,"When Gold's closed they sold their contracts to LA Fitness. Their equipment is kept clean and up to date, friendly staff available for questions and there were many locations in the area. There are many different classes available and other programs to keep you and the entire family occupied. But I would love to see a juice bar. In the weights, there is too much grunting and it made me feel like I was back at Gold's gym having to listen to a bunch of muscle men trying to lift weights."
446,2434941,2017-05-09,4,"La Fitness was highly recognized by other people to me. It has a lot of mirrors to watch your productivity and plenty of Good staff and really clean with lots of different machines and staff was always nearby to assist in any way that was. Sometimes it is just too crowded and for me it's a little too expensive. But the place was well taken care of all the time and fresh smelling. Also, the location was good until I moved. I was moving out of the immediate area and it was just going to be too far to travel there as much as I wanted to."
447,2434752,2017-05-09,3,"LA Fitness has a high number of machines which is really good for the busy hours, as the wait times for the standard, run of the MILL machines could get pretty long. This gym is what you would expect for the price. It's busy, but well run with working machinery and obviously well maintained facility. I prefer gyms that aren't so packed. However, peak hours were just way too packed, even though the gym had lots of machines and time limits per use. Best recommendation to avoid this would be to take in less members or expand the size of the gym."
448,2435025,2017-05-09,4,"LA Fitness is great as it is. If anything does come up, I will be sure to let Steph know if there could be anything done to improve. There's a lot of room, plenty of cardio machines, a basketball gym, a pretty spacious yoga room, great block or rooms with Greek showers, and also the staff is very nice, and the vending machine options are greedy as they are very health geared. LA fitness has been everything I expected and more. When my friends told me about the gym I expected it to be pretty good, but when I got there it was even better than what they described. The people were awesome, and I mean that with the most respect and generosity, they went above and beyond. They did a lot of things that I didn't feel like they had to do and that's just struck my heart a little bit."
449,2434860,2017-05-08,3,"LA Fitness has awesome price, accessible fee and you can find the clubs in a lot of places, cities or states. The clubs are very clean and there are a lot of showers, free soap, etc. I also chose them because they have a Jacuzzi, pool, steamers and new equipment. However, nobody (teachers, employees, personal trainers) helps you if you was doing exercises wrong, for example, you can't find hip-hop classes in all units, etc."
450,2434671,2017-05-08,5,"LA Fitness has convenient locations. They're spread evenly across Long Island and it's quite amazing. Whatever town I may be stuck in, there's always an LA Fitness. It's always very clean and I love all the different types of machines and workouts they have to offer. I hope they have cheaper prices but I would go there again definitely."
451,2434947,2017-05-08,4,"My friend introduced LA Fitness and I go with her from time to time. I don't really go there as often because it's not convenient as it is too far from me and I can't go there as often before or after work. I wish it had a cheaper membership too. But, I like that it has good equipment. It's clean, it has friendly people working there, people aren't snobs and it has high-tech things. It's a nice place to go to and I don't feel judged there."
452,2434764,2017-05-08,4,LA fitness did meet and exceed my expectations. I got everything I really needed and felt it was worth the minimal monthly cost of being a member. I like that it has a pool and access to personal trainers. It was always clean with a friendly and helpful staff. It was well worth the investment. It would be nice if there were more options as far as machines go and a variety of classes. I would also like a nicer locker room with access to a sauna or steam room to unwind after a workout.
453,2435031,2017-05-08,3,I didn't like this gym very much. The people there were pretentious and lied about membership prices plus they were super pushy to clients so they can renew their contract. But it’s close to home.
454,2434620,2017-05-07,4,"LA Fitness is close to my house. I have easy access. This gym is great and I am used to it. I have been a member for 2 years. They play music throughout the gym so you don't have to bring an iPod. All the options are open to any gym member. You are more inspired to become fitter than ever. With a gym card you have access to all parts of the gym. You are welcome to run on the treadmills, use the weights and there are also TVs in the rooms for the gym people to enjoy. After your training session you are also welcome to relax in the sauna, which personally is my favorite feature. What I dislike about the gym is that most people are often possessive and I have gotten robbed there before. And you are not allowed food in there but hey it is a gym. Their equipment could use a little replacing. I found some rusty weights yesterday."
455,2434899,2017-05-07,4,"I initially chose LA fitness for proximity to home and work. They were also running a special through my organization. Location is my number one consideration when choosing a gym. I liked the classes offered, spin and zumba specifically. I liked the cardio machines. They had a good amount as most gyms don't meet demand. I used cardio machines primarily while I was pregnant. I often had to get ready for work after my workout and would've appreciated nicer bathrooms with more counter space, better lighting and updated showers."
456,2434713,2017-05-07,5,LA fitness has met and exceeded my expectations. I think they are a great gym. I've been a member for a couple years. They have so many options between the different classes and all the machines. You can get the best workout and body and experience at this gym. They could update the machines a little more but all in all it's a great gym to be a part of. Whether you're a beginner or advanced this is a great place to be.
457,2434989,2017-05-07,5,"I chose this gym because it has all the latest gym equipment with all features. There are various classes which are free to attend with membership. They have personalized classes. They have classes early morning and late evening during weekdays so that my work is not impacted. I like step sculpting class. The instructors are very knowledgeable and guide me really well. They cater to my concerns in a very professional way. There is sauna, squash court, swimming. So it has everything from gym to sports and is very close to my home. They have all the latest features and I love it. There is nothing to dislike. It is a perfect gym."
458,2435052,2017-05-07,4,"I chose LA fitness because it seems upscale and has a good clientele that care about their appearance. I enjoy working out there and this gym has met my expectations but it could lower its price and offer more classes. The premises also are a bit small and cramped. There aren't many locations so it can be difficult sometimes to find one when traveling. But I like LA fitness because it is chic and sophisticated. They have a great pool and clean equipment. Also, the locker room is well appointed and the price is reasonable."
459,2434809,2017-05-07,5,"I choose LA Fitness because most locations are very convenient to my workplace and home, and they have so many classes in the morning and evening that works with my schedule, daycare for my kids and good pool, as well as they offer very competitive rate to other nearby gyms. LA Fitness has so many group training classes that well with my schedule as a full time working business woman and a mother. I love coming to their pilates, yoga, barre and zumba class and they have the best instructors for almost every class. The only thing discourage me is just sometimes it is off when I see the level of hygiene is below my standard and I am afraid of sharing equipments with others. But I love the gym and going there really does motivate me to keep a healthy lifestyle other than just exercising at home myself."
460,2434818,2017-05-06,4,"La Fitness is a place where you train, you exercise, where you have to have a lot of perseverance and discipline. Apart from what is good for health you feel in energy, the gym is a good way to be with yourself, a free space where you relax and you are full of energy so you can know how to take your day to. Also, I chose this gym because it is clean and there are good coaches that work with you. However, they can improve on hygiene and attention. How wonderful it is not to leave the gym."
461,2434629,2017-05-06,2,"Large two floor gym with a lot of variety of machines, both weight and cardio. They have a basketball court, and a few racquetball courts and an exercise studio. The changing rooms and showers are spacious and the pool water is better than at most pools. It's the best. The gym seemed to be very spacious at first and fun to go to. It was nicely maintained. However, ever since they took over Bally, the gym has been over crowded and uncomfortable. It makes it more unpleasant to exercise there because you have to constantly wait. Also, the exercise classes don't have enough variety for everyone, like older people and there is only one room, except for the spin class. The exercise classes are just not geared toward everyone and have terrible music."
462,2434911,2017-05-06,5,"LA Fitness offers group fitness classes along with various machines like treadmills, elliptical, rowing as well as free weights and weight machines. They have beautiful and clean single sex showers. Child care is also available. The location that I used was the downtown Silver Spring and it was one of the selling points because it is close to work so I could use it before or after work. The hours are also convenient to my lifestyle. The membership fee, while not the cheapest around, is okay and the facility is aesthetically pleasing. I haven't been to the gym in a while but I would like more personal trainer sessions included in the membership fee. A swimming pool would be a nice addition along with pool exercise classes."
463,2434725,2017-05-06,5,"I choose LA fitness because I heard great things about them and they offered me a free pass for a couple weeks and I fell in love with the gym after only couple of days and I now am a permanent member and very loyal. I like how it's great operating hour access and that I can always bring a guest along, that they have clean bathrooms and clean showers and that they have a wide variety of workout equipment and more than enough room to move around. They also have competitive prices and great staff members who are always ready to help out and they also have personal trainers."
464,2435001,2017-05-06,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere. I like that it is big enough to house the traffic it obtains. The sales person was very helpful in picking my membership. Multiple amenities, easy access, and clean facilities. The staff is interested in helping you after you sign up for the membership. However, it's too busy and there's too much commotion around me while I exercise. But the gym has met my expectations. I have been able to exercise and get into shape. It was easy for me to drive too and if I travel for work, I am able to go into multiple locations."
465,2435058,2017-05-06,5,"We come here because it's convenient and easy to find but the pressure from sales staff to close on deal is annoying. I like the freedom of paying a monthly fee without being tied to the contract for an amount of time. Stop approaching me like car salesman. But it's a good gym. It's nice, open, and It's always clean. We like the babysitting area, and the smoothie shop. Also, I enjoy knowing I have a lot of flexibility when it comes to classes. Having a lot of choices is great. I like LA Fitness' hours, and it's never overly crowded. Their equipment is great, too. There is always a location somewhere and we can work out anywhere we go when we travel."
466,2434647,2017-05-05,5,"LA FITNESS is a wonderful amazing gym with a ton of energizing people there to keep you upbeat and focused on your goals. The trainers they employ are absolutely awesome and work and encourage you every step of the way! Also, the multiple TVs around the gym are awesome with a different show on every one. However, I would just encourage the clients that come in to work out on machines for longer periods of time to clean their machines very well when they are done. They may also want to hire some people during the busier hours to go around and disinfect the machines better than what the user did. But LA Fitness has definitely met my expectations and beyond! I would most definitely recommend it to anyone."
467,2434923,2017-05-05,5,"This gym exceeds expectations. It is always clean, equipment is always available. Has every piece of equipment and lots of volume of peak use equipment and a ton of treadmills! But I wish they had more squat rack options. They do have one and one assisted rack but the weights are not organized like some other gyms I have been at. However it is close enough than another gym we go to. It also feels newer than most others, doesn't have that grimy feeling. Also, they have a store with the ability to make protein shakes. I also love that they have a pool."
468,2434737,2017-05-05,4,"My biggest pet peeve with regard to gyms is the atmosphere. Sometimes, having too much equipment and not enough trainers to balance it out, gyms can be intimidating for first timers. LA fitness is definitely not like that at all, and that makes it an exception to most of the other gyms that I have visited. I really liked the atmosphere of the LA fitness gym. It was not as imposing as most gyms seem, and the people there were very helpful when I would ask questions or needed help. But I did not like the lack of classes and planned events at this particular location. I was looking for a yoga class that met regularly, but the meeting times for the group housed within the gym were sporadic at best. They were very irregular, and the instructor was hypercritical."
469,2435013,2017-05-05,5,"This gym has met my expectations; although I didn't go in, with high ones to begin with. I'm good as long as it's clean and the people there are respectful. They have various equipment to chose, along with a variety of classes to chose from if I'm bored just walking on the treadmill. I like the pool and sauna also, just overall very accommodating. I do not believe there is really anything to improve. Maybe some vending machines that sold cold beverages. Also, if it was possible for the trainers to be free, that would be wonderful too, but I know people have to work to earn money for a living."
470,2435064,2017-05-05,4,"When I go to the gym my main concern is being able to get a good workout in inside a clean and safe facility. This gym has a great selection of workout equipment. I also like that some of the facilities have pools. I also enjoy the classes, specifically the yoga class as well as the cycling class. It's cool that some facilities have a kids' area for parents who may have to bring their children with them to the gym. Another great feature is the locker room. It is very spacious and I remember seeing a sauna. Overall it is a good gym and there is not much that I would improve. It may be cool if the gym had an area to purchase refreshments like smoothies, salads, and other healthy food options. Another option would be to extend the weight lifting area, at least at the gym that I go to. It's always crowded, which is not the worse thing. A tennis court would be nice to have. I chose this gym because of the location in proximity to my home. LA fitness is also well known and has a great reputation. The fees were also not bad."
471,2434842,2017-05-04,5,"Well it had everything I'm looking for in a gym. Plus the offer we got was great also. The trainer was also awesome. He pushed me to workout with my knee that I was scared to use to workout. He encouraged me to work hard to achieve my goals. What I do is work out with the trainer, then I jump in the sauna. They have showers as well as lockers to put up your things. And The staff is friendly and very helpful. They make going to the gym easy and comfortable. I love that the gym has the pool but I do not like that it is not monitored. I see people hop in the pool dirty. I mean you are supposed to wash off before. I hate that no one follows the rules. Not everyone wipes down the equipment, too. So I find myself doing it before and after a workout. These are the only things that I dislike. I've been in other gyms and this makes me feel comfortable. I want to do everything that'll help me stay fit. I want to tone, I have a machine that works great for me there."
472,2434656,2017-05-04,5,"LA Fitness was the closest to my home, so I checked it out and received a very good discount or promotion at the time. Nice, clean environment, great equipment, and friendly staff that made me feel comfortable to work out there and willing to help show me the ropes. Because of my weight I was uncomfortable in front of some of the other people there working out, but the staff didn't make me feel that way! All in all it was a nice place to go for my workout."
473,2434932,2017-05-04,3,The pool and the equipment is decent. There are plenty of locations to choose from. I dislike the misleading information given by some of the gym salespeople. They should not intentionally mislead customers into thinking the contract can be easily cancelled. But I like the equipment is easy to cycle around and there is a pool to swim in after working out. The universal equipment was large and there was plenty of room to workout. This gym was average overall considering the hard selling the employees engage in.
474,2434749,2017-05-04,4,"LA fitness has the newest and most modern machines. Everything is always clean and well maintained. Their installations are convenient as well. LA fitness met my expectations because you get what you pay for. It is very affordable. They have nice pool and bathrooms/changing rooms. The majority of the staff is very nice, especially the kids club people. However, their sales agents are kind of aggressive. They try to sell you extra stuff. It’s either getting a personal coach that is usually very expensive or buy items from their store like shakes or powders."
475,2435022,2017-05-04,4,I like that the gym was a large size with a lot of machines to use. They also provided all the information needed to use any machine in the gym. Also that the price was right and the hours that they were open. The staff was very friendly and helpful with all questions and showed you anything you needed to know about the machines in the gym. I wish there were more classes to take and also bigger men's room to chance and shower. This would be an excellent idea to improve the gym experience.
476,2435070,2017-05-04,5,"I loved the pool and hot tub at LA fitness. I like cost, the staff friendliness and ease of working in on sets. There was plenty of cardio and free weights, as well as weight machines. Other patrons were happy to share space, friendly and relaxed as well as willing to help or offer advice. The kid care was good and you can pay a bit more to bring a friend as much as you want. Even though the pool area was great it wasn't always functioning. The hot tub is a great feature but 60 percent of the time, it was closed for maintenance. They can have maintenance scheduled during hours they are not open. There were also ""pool hogs"" that would stay in a lane for hours, and the staff didn't seem to monitor it. The personal training lead was a bit sloppy. The trainers (especially the head of the department) seemed less than professional. His knowledge was dated and he showed up for our session with a greasy bag of Burger King. The racquetball courts were always full and the people in the rooms were not playing racquetball, but instead were stretching or doing yoga or working abs. The classes were quite good but got very full, a second studio for the popular classes would have been wonderful. If they had some type of fitness challenge would have been great as a way of encouragement. The experience was much more comfortable than any I had at other franchises, where the employees didn't seem to care whether you had a good experience or not."
477,2434854,2017-05-03,4,My friend and I had always wanted to try out going to a gym instead of working out at home. We tried LA Fitness and loved it. I enjoyed them and it was my favorite gym for a long time. We got a good price and they were not as expensive as we thought they would be. They always had clean towels and water. I loved their equipment as well and the gym is very well maintained. The employees were very friendly and cared and spoke to you in a professional manner. But they would get a lot more business if they were open twenty-four hours a day. That way more people can enjoy their gym no matter what their schedules look like. It opens the opportunity for a lot more business and also satisfied customers. This is the only reason I left this gym. I worked odd hours and I am a student. Being busy you can’t go to a gym at normal hours or at the same time every day. Other than the business hours I have no complaints on LA Fitness.
478,2434665,2017-05-03,5,"I like LA Fitness and choose this gym over others because the machines are always up to date and top notch, always work as they should work, are innovative, fun to use, always give a great workout. The place is clean, and fun and has a nice assortment of clientele. LA Fitness is very good as is, however there are a few small things they could improve upon including larger and more storage areas for your gear and personal belongings, and maybe add some more bathrooms, or bathroom space. But overall great gym to work out in. They have great customer service and it's a pleasure to belong to this gym."
479,2434944,2017-05-03,3,"I chose LA fitness because I heard many great things about it online and it was a well taken care of place. Everything was very clean and in good shape. It has a very good place for your kids too if you have any while you work out. And the gym is very enormous and awesome and there are many people working there so there is a lot of supervision for the kids. However, there are always a lot of kids there and it gets very crowded and very noisy in that room and they can be heard from the gym rooms and the gym rooms get very crowded too."
480,2434761,2017-05-03,4,"My expectations have been met for this gym. I was looking for a state of the art gym like we had in college and LA fitness is comparable to some extent. It's close by, multiple locations, ability to go to any location without a fee, ability to bring guests. The pool, sauna, group fitness classes, trainers, reliable and amount of workout equipment are all great parts of the gym. There are a lot of machines to choose from. Cleanliness can be better and an upgrade to the bathrooms are needed. I've been to multiple locations where rust and mold were present. I rarely see employees cleaning equipment."
481,2435028,2017-05-03,5,"I like the amenities, the locations, the prices. The women, and there are good looking men too for you gals out there. The machines are four star, never dirty. All in all what’s not to like about this place? Although they need more than one communal shower. It’s fine at 5 in the morning but in the afternoon it’s jammed pack and the shower is packed too. The girls and I go in the afternoon so I can’t shower there. Not a big deal but it’s always wondered me. But this gym has charisma over other gyms. No themes, no gimmicks, no hidden fees. Just makes you feel welcome. It’s got heart, spunk, soul. It’s just a great gym. What more can I say?"
482,2434872,2017-05-02,5,"I like many features about LA Fitness and it has completely met my expectations. They offer a wide variety of equipment and the facility is always clean. The gym is always judgment-free and there is a spacious locker room, and friendly staff too. I have gotten a great workout experience. But sometimes it is hard to get the machine I desire or the gym is too crowded. The gym can also be too cold at times which I do not enjoy. I also wish there was a sauna and a better membership program for students."
483,2434683,2017-05-02,5,"LA fitness is always clean. The employees are nice, friendly & always greet you with a smile & are very helpful. If you are having any problems with any piece of equipment they will come over as quickly as possible to help you out so you can finish up. Best customer service by far. The equipment is up to date & not broken or not working. But I dislike guys that like to hang around just to watch the women work out. It's really creepy & happens all the time by the gym near my house. Some of other women can be catty sometimes about their stuff. Like they will cause a fuss just to get some attention."
484,2434956,2017-05-02,3,"I went to LA Fitness because it was where my boyfriend went. We liked that there was a sauna and there was a location close to our jobs, close to our house and off a main road and we could go to either one. I liked that there was a pool and that group exercises classes were offered. I liked that there were different types of equipment too. The pool was also large. I did not like the floor plan because it was too open and that was intimidating. I was on display for the whole gym. I also wish they had a smoothie cafe and or a snack bar."
485,2434779,2017-05-02,3,"All of the other gyms in my area were locally owned and few of them were doing well enough to have what I needed. I'd love to support local businesses, but I can't compromise my workout for it. LA fitness is very clean. I don't have to worry when I sit at a machine if anything gross could be on it. Everything is also well maintained and I've never seen any equipment out of service. It's really pricey just to look nice. Feature wise it's nothing special but they sure charge you for it. The price also seems to attract the most careless kind of people, I often feel the other patrons might hurt themselves trying to use the equipment."
486,2435037,2017-05-02,3,"I loved how big the group classroom is. There is plenty of room to participate in the class and move around without bumping into each other. I also love that they have pools and nice locker rooms there. However, the membership staff are very pushy. They also rush you through the tour of the gym. We almost felt obligated and pressured into the membership. I wish there was a separate weight area for women. The majority of the free weight section was crowded with men and made it difficult to get in and do lower weights at higher reps. I'd also offer more classes at off times for those of us who work in healthcare. Early morning and late night classes would be ideal. In hindsight, we chose this gym because of the proximity to our home, hours of operation, and variety of classes."
487,2397222,2017-05-01,1,Avoid this gym at all costs. They pressure you into signing a 12 month contract for personal trainer services which sounds good until you realize that you can rarely get a personal trainer at the time you want unless you want to book several months in advance or at 6am or 9pm. The gyms themselves are dirty and crowded and it's virtually impossible to get on some of the equipment. When you try to cancel your membership they make as difficult as they possibly can and continue to take money from your account even if you cancel your payments.
488,2396403,2017-05-01,1,"I signed up my husband, daughter and myself. I added my youngest daughter to my VIP list so she could try it out before I got her a membership. She finally decided to come with us about four days into our membership. We went to the front desk. The lady at the front took her full name and also had me sign a waiver. She advised me that we would receive an email with her official pass. We went in to enjoy our day. Today we went in to work out again. Taylor was at the front desk I told her that I still didn't get an email for my daughter. She said I needed to speak to one of the guys. Unfortunately they were all busy so we proceeded to use the gym facilities. After getting on the treadmill in the ladies section. Taylor came in to harass me and my family. She said none of us were able to use the gym facilities without me signing the waiver. At that point I explained to her again that I already signed a waiver for my daughter and gave her details but I didn't get the email for her pass. She took my email and said she would take care of it and there was no need for me to worry. I told her if there was an issue to come back to see me. Instead of her coming back she had Korosh call me on my cell phone to harass me some more. Korosh was rude, disrespectful and unprofessional. Shouting at me on the phone stating I needed to come down right now to see him cause I didn't have a membership for my daughter. He went on to tell me he needed my daughter's driver's license. I explained to him my daughter was only 14 and didn't have a driver's licenses. I told him the waiver was already signed and I gave all her details. He was rude and told me if I don't have a driver's licenses he would need her health card. I didn't bring my purse to the gym so I explained I didn't have a health card either. At this point I felt very uncomfortable and disrespected to say the least. So I went downstairs to speak to the guy.Korosh was with a client and I told him ""I'm here. You felt the need to interrupt me while I was working out cause it was urgent. Let's speak right now"" cause this entire experience occurred due to their lack of professionalism and substandard efficiency. He was even more rude and said I needed to stand at the side to speak to him after he was harassing me. After speaking to the girl at the front I found out... The first person I spoke to didn't input my daughter into the system. They also have no way to confirm if a waiver is in the system. I also found out that some of them do not understand their own internal systems and procedures. We spoke to one of the staff that advised us he could activate my daughter's guest pass as of today. Such a insult after embarrassing me and my family in front of everyone in the ladies section. I closed my account the exact same day. My daughters were very disappointed cause the facilities were perfect for our needs and convenient for our schedule. However, the lack of adequate professionalism and basic respect is something I demand in all interactions. To boot I requested to be booked on the general manager Garry schedules to discuss the matter in more details only to find out he only works from 10-2pm every day. He also has no email address available to forward any complains. I am unsure how anyone can get any issue rectified with hours like that, especially training your young staff. Now I have to wait 2 whole weeks for my full refund. I hope it actually comes. Based on my experience I doubt it!! DO NOT GO TO LA FITNESS!! Looks good from the outside but they will have you feeling like crap."
489,2434878,2017-05-01,5,"LA Fitness has incredible class room and had a wonderful selection of classes at all times of the day. Many levels of yoga, belly dancing, cardio, cross fit and more. They also had a pool, a hot tub, sauna and various courts. It was always clean, had a great atmosphere and in a good location. Also, the price was good, got a good deal. But, their freelance personal trainers cycled through faster than a drunk lawyer drinking margaritas at happy hour. Every single time you came in there were new trainers and they would always solicit you while you were trying to work out. But overall, liked it very much."
490,2434692,2017-05-01,4,"LA Fitness was close to my work and my home. I like the hours they were open, they worked with my schedule. They had a pool, it was large and had all types of equipment that was available quickly. I liked that they had classes available and trainers that you could work with if you need them. The price was also reasonable. However, the gym was busy at certain times of the day but that's something that can't be helped. The smell of the pool was also extremely strong. Sometimes other gym goers didn't clean off the equipment but that also can't really be helped. But LA Fitness mostly met my expectations."
491,2434965,2017-05-01,4,"LA fitness has a phenomenal personal training program. I was unsure at first after LA fitness bought the local gym that I had been exercising at for a few years but they bring a level of professionalism that a small chain can't compare! This gym was a surprise. I wasn't expecting the quality. When they purchased the local gym they remodeled and filled it with brand new equipment! It's fantastic but costly. Nevertheless, I love the state of the art equipment and supplements available."
492,2435040,2017-05-01,5,"When I was a member of LA Fitness eight years ago, the location was convenient as it was right next to my office and it was always open. I enjoyed the cleanliness of the locker rooms. Plus, the showers and gym area was wonderful. However, the layout of some of the machines was awkward."
493,2434785,2017-05-01,4,"My mom and sister were both LA Fitness members. And when I was staying with my mom for a few months, I still want it to work out so I chose this gym. It definitely met my expectations and I was able to enjoy the free weights and especially the pool. It's a large gym with a huge variety of machines to use. There’s also different people who come to the gym so if you are not in the best shape you don't feel like an outsider. Being a large gym also have its disadvantages. While the workers are friendly and you have a lot of space it is hard to connect to others. It would be nice to have more social engagements where other people who work out at the gym were able to get together. There aren't many LA Fitness locations which is another downside because it would be nice to be able to work out when I'm in other places away from my home gym."
494,2395683,2017-04-30,1,"When I first joined the gym, they were quick to take my almost $3000 for the membership. When I joined I informed them about my back issues. They were like, ""No problem. We will help you."" Of course that's just to get people to sign up. I haven't been to the gym in a couple months and when I can I asked if someone could show me how to use the machines that won't injure my back well they were not helpful to say the least. Their attitude was like ""If we show you how to use the machine and you injure yourself"". ""Well isn't the point of you assisting me with the machine is so that I use it properly and nor cause injury to myself."" They outright refused to assist me. I felt pressured get a personal trainer which is what they were pushing for. I shouldn't have to Pay an extra thousand dollars for a personal trainer just to show me how to use the machines. I think it's poor customer service and poor management. I came here super excite to get healthy and get help. Not so."
495,2434866,2017-04-30,5,"LA Fitness has better workout gear and equipment in comparison to other gyms. Their monthly fee is more affordable given all the club and swimming features. I can have my own personal trainer and I can play sports as an alternative. However, I would improve the spacing of the place and their regular membership access to some of the features and not just include special features to VIP guests."
496,2434677,2017-04-30,5,First of all the location of this gym is very convenient for me because after doing an hour or so on the gym the last thing I want to do is to have a long drive when my body is already drain for doing exercises. Plus I always wanted a place that serves more than a gym but can also inspire you to be the best you can. They have a lot of equipment that I can use for exercising plus it's a great place. The people there are very friendly and accommodating to the customers' needs so you won't feel like being an outcast. But I hope they could get more new equipment because as years goes by new exercise equipment will be made which will help you what you want to achieve.
497,2434953,2017-04-30,3,"I am satisfied with this gym for the low cost. I get basic membership for a very low cost of 25 dollars a month because this gym chain is partnered with my health insurance. There is a good variety of equipment and classes. The LA fitness location I joined also has a nice large pool. There is a good aqua aerobics teacher that teaches a class on Friday mornings. However, I would prefer a smaller gym that is more personal. There could also be more showers for the size of the gym. There are many members and frequently there is a line to use the shower."
498,2434773,2017-04-30,4,LA fitness definitely met my expectations. Variety of locations across the US and you can use any of them. The price was good when you signed up for a year at a time. It's a good looking gym. The equipment is easy to use and it was a big gym with a variety of equipment. I felt comfortable there. I liked the feeling and it felt good. A few things could be improved. It DID seem a little outdated as far as the design is concerned. Still okay though and nothing too crazy. But that's not too big of a deal.
499,2435034,2017-04-30,5,"Good equipment. The equipment here is very up to date and clean. They are very good at quickly fixing broken machines. The decor of the gym is also very cute and well thought out. I guess to some that would not matter, but it keeps you distracted from the calories you are currently burning. But there was not always a very big variety when it comes to cardio machines. I like lifting weights, but I prefer to do more cardio targeted exercising. The gym is very close to where I currently reside. Overall it is a great gym. The convenience it provides before going to work is my primary reason for choosing this particular gym."
500,2378787,2017-04-23,1,"I called to cancel. They told me I have to do it in person. I did not have time to come in that month and forgot about it. I got charged again. I called again to cancel and told them I don't have time to drive in just to cancel, so please cancel me. They refused to cancel me. They offered to send an email with the cancellation form. I said, ""Ok."" They did not send a cancellation form. They sent me a link to sign up for the online account so I could print my cancellation form. I signed up. Then I was locked out because recently my credit card was lost/stolen. And because they were not able to charge that card, I got a $10 fee added to my charges (even though, if someone would listen to me, I no longer want to continue to go to the gym)!I needed to update my billing info so they could charge me again before I could cancel. Nope. Not gonna happen. LA Fitness will not get any of my credit card or banking info ever again. I received numerous phone calls from California the very next day. I called them back and explained my situation. They gave me an email to use to cancel. I wrote an email asking to cancel. They replied with ""To protect the privacy of our customers..."" that I must cancel online or in person at the gym. Well, well, well, didn't I just get sent around the world and back to arrive back at where I was originally. Nice work LA Fitness.It's a shame that businesses like LA Fitness have to resort to taking advantage of their consumers instead of just running an honest business. Why do they use this process for cancellations? In hopes that you forget and get charged again. Or in hopes that you don't send the form in time and you get charged again. It's amazing. I never thought a gym would try to hold me hostage financially. But that's exactly what they do.Truth is, all they have to do to cancel is press a button. But they refuse to even if you ask them to do so several times. I look forward to the 3 phone calls a day now from a company who sells a product that I no longer use, will never use again, a company who I pleaded with several times to just please cancel my membership. I will also look forward to LA Fitness tagging on the next charge plus a late charge next month because I heard from other people that that's what they'll do. My buddy asked to cancel over the phone months ago and they actually did it for him over the phone. But me? I guess I wasn't lucky like him, and now I'm in a huge battle with a gym over this cancellation.One more funny comment. They used the phrase ""to protect the privacy of its members...""??? Thanks LA Fitness for protecting my privacy, because Lord knows I wouldn't want anyone to know I'm canceling a gym membership (sarcasm). Your cancellation policies are just a scam to squeeze more money out of people, honest good people I might add."
501,2371068,2017-04-20,1,"I signed up for membership during winter time 2016. The shower was ice cold, they don't have hot water and also it is very dirty. I don't think they clean it at all.. The lockers are rested inside and not clean at all..."
502,2362509,2017-04-17,1,"I have to say as a member which started in LA fitness was a gym I liked about the courts, the pool, the sauna and much more. However, the pool is not heated most of the time, The sauna is always closed. The basketball court the hoops have no nets. I was kinda shocked when I saw all of this. The gym overall is like Planet fitness without the pool and without the court. The fees is outright ridiculous. I find that they charge way overpriced. I've canceled because I felt it waste and not worth the money. I don't mind paying but for the money I rather go back to Planet fitness which I was much happier there than LA fitness. Their staff pressures you. They over charge you and mislead you and then the gym is really not worth the money. Plus planet fitness staff they're nicer people and they want to help and work with you. LA fitness all they want is your money. They really don't want to help you plus their trainers are all nasty as well."
503,2354442,2017-04-13,1,"LA Fitness is the WORST. I un-recommend this gym to anyone reading this. I'm paying for an all-access membership, which I was told from the outset gets me access into any location in the country. Went on vacation and they are charging me $5 for every out-of-state visit. NICKEL AND DIMING. I wasn't even informed about the charges - discovered them online. Customer service sucks. Manager Erica ** was unhelpful, unfriendly and unsympathetic. Their best solution is to ""upgrade."" Hell no, they'll be lucky if I even keep my membership after this. Not to mention there was no hot water in the women's shower for MONTHS at my home location in freezing mid-winter... And a missing hair dryer around the same time period that did not get replaced for days."
504,2338782,2017-04-07,1,I cancelled my membership with this company and after cancelling they still charged me. When I called to speak with customer service they said that I did not cancel the membership online and I could not do it over the phone. They referred me to the adhesion contract and said that according to the contract I could not get my money back because after 3 months of being charged and not cancelling made me unable to refuse the charges. I could not get my money back and I was charged 2 extra months.
505,2337954,2017-04-07,1,"Stay away! LA Fitness is a scam! They took payment for a full one-year membership, announced that they were closing the gym and then refused to refund the remainder of my membership because there is another gym 2 miles away! Sharp and dishonest business tactics!"
506,2334795,2017-04-06,1,"Barcode #s ** and ** have been members for a little over a year and a half, and been personally trained, quite well I might add, by Brian at the Hospitality Lane San Bernardino LA Fitness facility. We have always felt welcome and well cared for there and enjoyed both the original facility as well as the exemplary new facility. For that, we thank you most sincerely. Brian is an outstanding trainer that has given us so much knowledge and encouragement as well as improved our overall well-being. Someone we will not soon forget. Someone who we consider a friend. The staff was equally friendly and uplifting with their attitude as well. We will also miss them. Unfortunately, in November we moved some 60+ miles away. Within the first week we were seeking a local gym that we could continue going to. That was all derailed in mid December, the evening of the 14th to be precise, when I was struck by a motorist performing an illegal lane change while I was on my way to work in the ER where I am a nurse. I made it to work alright, but as a patient. A broken hand that was ran over during the accident and a separated and broken collar bone, all on the right side (dominant side) has kept me out of work as well as the gym since.Soon thereafter, amongst the chaos our lives had been thrust into, we contacted the gym to put everything on hold as ** is now in the position where she must work 7 days a week to help recover the loss of my income. I, quite understandably, have limited mobility and capabilities and most assuredly, cannot drive. I was told by the individual at the Hospitality Lane gym that it was taken care of. Alas, the approximately $280 was taken from the account which led us to overdraft fees. I received a call stating there was a problem with the payment from a gym in Round Rock Texas. Mind you, we live in Los Angeles, and the individual eventually advised I call my home gym. Both of us, bewildered, went about our prescribed tasks. Me calling the home gym and he scratching his head wondering why I was returning a call made from his gym in Texas. The same thing happened today but from Florida. I'm admittedly, perplexed, but no matter, onward we go. After talking to the gym, we were told it was taken care of again. Can you guess what happened this month? The $280 was again drafted from our account with another message saying that there was a problem with the payment. That is the most accurate and true statement I have heard yet. ""There was a problem with the payment on your account."" On that I am in total agreement, the draft and subsequent overdraft fees should have never have happened. Again. I am finally, after speaking with Florida? (returned call), San Bernardino, and then the 949-255-7200, I am told that now I need a written note from my doctor saying I am excused from gym time, much akin to an elementary school child. (Even as distraught as I am over this, humor can be found in almost anything, thusly helping us remain civil.)Now, my one year contract had expired and with no big ado it became a month to month agreement. Being unable to travel and ** working 7 days a week to try to make ends meet, I was told all was well only to find out today that I needed to provide 30 days written notice and a note from my doctor now. Had this been said earlier, well, a lot could have been avoided. I understand that for an employee, with the common knowledge amongst the ranks, that you sometimes assume that the customer knows these things as well. I do not believe I was intentionally not given this information. And then in later conversations, it was probably assumed that I already had this information also. It happens, I get it. However, I then proceeded with my processes of trying to put back together the other pieces of life (and broken body parts) under the false impression that it was taken care of.As a digression, the numbers from our membership have been substituted for our names to emphasize just how much we have been made to feel like a number in this process and not as actual humans with lives and feelings and problems and triumphs that we go through. In my last phone conversation I truly felt as if I were Sisyphus with his eternal plight rolling the boulder uphill only to watch it roll back to the bottom signifying the beginning of his toils again, having any precept of progress obliterated. I further realize that customer service reached a whimpering end when trampled to death by the Dollar Sign, Automation and a general disdain for human interaction. To that end, I realized that there was no need to continue any further and to then arm myself with the greatest weapon I have ever had in my armory, my voice. Perhaps someone of import will hear and prevent this from happening in the future to someone else.All I ever wanted was to not be charged for a service we were unable to partake of, at least until we were at a point in life where we could again. I looked forward to the day where I returned to the gym and began the arduous task of restoring my body back to its pre-accident status and then keep working on my personal fitness goals. Even now, all I ask is for the right thing to be done. I don't want reimbursed for overdraft fees to time lost or mental anguish, free or discounted gym time or any other such nonsense, just what should have been done 2 months ago. Not to have the moneys drafted from our account so we can pay our bills as we need to until this ordeal has run its course and we can get back to some semblance of normalcy. An error was made, it was compounded, we are paying the price, dearly. It may not seem like much to you, but it makes a world of difference in our lives.To put a person to these numbers: ** = Susan, Mother of 6 wonderful and brilliant children, Registered Nurse who works in the ER as a trauma nurse and pediatric emergency nurse, preceptor and teacher to new nurses, holder of a Nursing Degree and Business degree, loves to surprise bake for coworkers, travel with her children and experience all life has to offer and seek out the beauty in life's little things. ** = Joel, Former Paramedic, Fire Fighter and US Army First Sergeant Nurse, Medic and Engineer, Civilian ER Nurse, Vocal Actor, loves enjoying nature with Susan and her children, woodworking and riding his motorcycle with Susan who has taught him how to first love himself, then love others and life to the fullest. With this I close and shall withhold my reviews from social media until a response is heard."
507,2297799,2017-03-22,1,"While I was working out a the Richfield, MN location Monday, March 20, an employee identifying himself as a VP told me to leave an area newly restricted for trainers and their clients. I refused, telling him I was promised from day one that I would have access to this area to do stability exercises, the only reason I joined the gym. I'm 66 and have poor balance, so I need this area to workout in, as it is out of the traffic flow and has the necessary equipment. He got up in my face and told me to get out. When I still refused, he grabbed me. I shouted loudly for him to get his hand off me, to make sure others saw what he was doing. He did release me, but then began placing his body within inches of mine to restrict my movements, making me even more unsteady. When was done, and went to the treadmill, the police showed up. It seems he told them I was not a member and was trespassing. Later that evening, I saw that he had indeed canceled my membership, but several hours after the encounter with the police."
508,2288268,2017-03-18,1,"I called to get a refund cause I cancelled my membership in January. They didn't attempt to take money for February, no. In March they nailed for 40 dollar. When I am attempted to get a refund they call the cops."
509,2282664,2017-03-16,1,"Workers are not informed of anything that's going on in the location. If you have or ask a question they will tell you: ""I don't know!"" They need better training in customer service and class instructors either are late or don't show up. Communication is not something that's important to them. Very dissatisfied!!!"
510,2278650,2017-03-15,1,"I should've first read the horrible online reviews, I know. Cancellation was ridiculous -- they make it very hard, intentionally. Autopay on credit card goes on and on. Your first month was prepaid, which you'll probably also forget. Essentially, you have a two month delay at the end, at best. Call corporate if you have problems. Don't them blow you off. We moved to a town with no clubs within an hour away and were able to finally get the deposit and recent charge returned. They called it a ""two month refund,"" but it's not -- it's your own money you get back that you paid upon signing. Anyway, hate their ripoff customer business practices. I went for yoga mostly, and treadmill. Yoga class was LOUD -- near bike class and basketball. Just a bad experience start to finish. Avoid if you have another choice, or READ YOUR CONTRACT, keeping it when you want out. Their verbal promises are totally meaningless. Read the written contract, follow it, go to classes if you like, but don't think for a moment you'll be treated fairly."
511,2266281,2017-03-09,1,"In 2012, I visited and toured a gym in New Brighton, MN and was not sure if I wanted to sign up after the tour. The salesperson called me for weeks and I gave in, all he needed was my CC# since I had left me details. A contract was filled in and signed (faked and used my initials), an email address I have never seen (saw the contract for the first time 3/2017). I was a member for 4 yrs till I lost my job. On 3/9/2017 I visited the location in West St Paul, MN intending to resume membership, I was told I owe $98. I last visited the gym in 4/2016 when I stopped paying. I notified the billing dept when they called. The Ops Manager at the Inver Grove location (Mr **) was rude to me. I told him I never signed a contract, he produced the contract with my initials doctored and fake email address. I told him I had never seen this, nor had anyone explained the need to have written cancellation until today (3/2017). This enabled them to continue billing 3 more months after I had told the billing department on the phone that I had no income and could no longer afford the gym. When I called corporate I was told that they ""continued my membership for 3 more months waiting for updated billing information"". How is that possible that they would want to bill me for May/June and July 2016 after I had told them in April of 2016 that I would not be able to afford the membership and stopped using the facilities.Apparently, they were more optimistic about my future financially than I was. Mr ** at the West St Paul location has no business representing a company in that manner, he was rude and hostile hoping to escalate our discussion, I remained calm and polite. I explained to him that I was holding LA Fitness to the same ethical standard I have of not using the facilities when I could not afford them and was unable to pay, likewise they need to reverse the 3 months of billing."
512,2265336,2017-03-09,1,"Several days ago the manager at the DADE COUNTY SOUTH LA FITNESS branch I attend switched three of the TV channels so they would always play Fox News. Several of us were very upset by this due to racist, hate speech made and/or tolerated by certain Fox News contributors. One lady asked the manager to change the station and he refused. She told us that she also wrote to corporate headquarters about it and they didn't ever bother to reply. Everyone is entitled to their own political opinions but a gym should be a neutral place. That is not the case at LA Fitness. I am canceling my membership."
513,2262957,2017-03-08,1,"I recently joined LA Fitness last November, when speaking to a consultant I let them know that I was a full-time student looking for the cheapest option of payment. They charged me $200 in initiation fees and let me know that I was paying $39.99 because I joined along a friend. I later found out that I was paying $70 a month. This is ridiculous! They didn't let me know till after I called to complain and paid the first 2 months. I've been trying to contact a consultant since January because a relative had just joined LA and was paying 25.99 a month for only one location which is exactly what I was doing but was paying too much more. I've been trying to contact someone at the Aurora LA Fitness for 1 months and they always say that no consultants are available and that they will call me back but NOBODY EVER DID. THIS IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TOTAL DISRESPECT!!! When going to the gym and speaking to a lady about this issue she said that the promotion was over and that she couldn't do anything about it even though I've been calling for a long time and had proof with a picture that I saw the promotion.Tonight I just got off the phone with an employee from the Aurora LA Fitness and he said I had to cancel my membership and charge me once again for the initiation fee to get the $25.99 a month. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS. We are the ones keeping them in business and they treat their customers like this. I do not recommend this gym unless you wanna get taking advantage of."
514,2250462,2017-03-03,1,"I recently moved from Michigan to California and joined LA Fitness as an additional member on my daughter's account in Fountain Valley. She had $2000 worth of personal training that was not being used and the personal training manager graciously allowed me utilize some of her remaining sessions. The new LA Fitness was being constructed and the manager of the personal trainers was very involved with the interest of my training and encouraged me to transfer to the new Huntington Beach location and continue to train. The Huntington Beach location opened and the sessions were coming to an end. I purchased an additional $3000 in personal training. After a couple of months I was not getting the results I was I asking for. I had conversations with my personal trainer with regards to this and nothing came about a change in regime. I did not plan to cancelled my membership, but have not been to LA Fitness since Nov. of 2016. I also have not scheduled a personal training session since Aug/Sept of 2016. I was not getting what I needed from the personal training. I was asking for a refund of my personal training sessions and nothing more. Having worked within the fitness industry and customer service for several years I did not I was asking for the impossible. I do feel that Clay, the district Vice President could have done more considering the amount of money my daughter and I have invested in his company. LA Fitness has done a disservice to me and my daughter. My daughter and I are service members working with the Coast Guard sector. We have been faithful LA Fitness members and had recently moved to California excited to meet new people who enjoyed the healthy lifestyle here in Orange County. I have now been removed from my daughter's account and cancelled my LA Fitness membership. I am very disappointed with the LA Fitness Corporation and they the way they handle customer support."

First of all during numerous calls, they never told me that I need to provide proof of relocation, until claim department of my bank got someone from LAF on the phone then they told me what and where I should send the documents. Even After they received the documents, still they are charging me on monthly basis. Location in Pittsburgh, PA. Worst experience ever!!"
516,2215344,2017-02-18,1,"My 1st visit to LA Fitness, Main St. Bridgeport CT today w/ a friend. I notice the girl at front desk was chatting on cell phone for about 5 minutes before coming to help. She was unfriendly, no personality. Finally had to sit down to fill out a questionnaire -- no problem. I gave age, name, but the question of my marital status I thought was irrelevant & had nothing to do with me working out. The rep said I had to answer that or be charged $15.00. That is ridiculous!!! I refused and left. I would never join or use for free LA Fitness because of the unfriendliness of front desk personnel & the unnecessary personal questions."
517,2212521,2017-02-17,1,"I will highly recommend for you not to go here. If you deal with Cyrus or Scott they will be very nice to your face until you sign the dotted line. It is the worst gym by far, it's very corporate, equipment sucks. This gym was taking money out of my account for 11 months without me knowing. When I confronted them about it they said they can't help me. When I called head office they said they'll only give me 3 months out of the 11 months owing. How is that right. Then the manager Scott said he would give me my 8 months plus 3 for reimbursement, I agreed to this. After 3 months they said I had to leave because my membership was up. They lie to your face. I could not believe it. It was very disappointing."
518,2204642,2017-02-15,1,"When I first went to this gym in Long Beach, I thought the facility looked nice, had a variety of equipment, and some friendly staff. My friend had also recommend this particular gym to me based on her initial experience with the staff. I was hesitant to join since I had heard from others that gym's had poor customer service, outdated/poorly maintained equipment, poor sanity conditions, along with other issues. I was also warned that the sales reps are pushy and misleading as to the services offered & contract conditions. The employees/trainers are aloof and treat you indifferently with scripted responses to every problem. I came to find out that all of those things were true. When I went to join, the sales rep pushed for me to sign up for a trainer for a whole year. I told him my goals and how I would be able to afford only the 6 month two times a week. He kept pushing for me to sign up for the full year and I kept repeating why I could not afford it and I was not that interested in a trainer. He then offered me 12 additional ""classes"" as part of a Business promotion, and I agreed to the 6 month trainers contract with the idea that I had a few more sessions to add to the ones I purchased. What he failed to mention was that I would be signed up for only two days a week with the trainer and these additional classes would have to be squeezed in at the discretion of the trainer and would expire if not used before the end of 6 month contract. I found this out after my first trainer. He was actually a nice guy and for the first month I was ok with my purchase. He helped to show me some of the basics of the equipment and good routines. The third month went by and he kept introducing me to different routines and machines and I was starting to wonder why we were not keeping to a regular routine until I asked him and he said that he wanted me to have a feel for all the types of equipment and exercises that could be done at that gym. I was also beginning to become frustrated with my trainer by this time. He began to arrive late to my 30 minute session and on multiple occasions he would leave me to finish the routine 5-10 minutes early to ""prepare"" for the next client. At this point I was ticked off and asked to use my additional classes. The trainer was not able to make room in his schedule and offered to have another trainer meet with me on a different day so I could use the additional sessions. This next trainer was far more blunt and less accommodating with my schedule and was hard to reach because he would not respond to text or phone calls and I would have to call the gym to reach him. This went on for a short while and at the end of it all I had not reached my goal and all of my ""free"" Sessions were not used and even two of my normal session were never used because of scheduling conflicts with the trainer and other clients. I asked to use the session, but it was at this time that the rep told me that I had to have used them while I was still under trainers contract. I voiced how upset I was by this and got a scripted response from the rep about how this was laid out in the contract and that if I wanted to I could sign up for another 6 months and he would honor the original deal. I told him I would not be using this service again and could not afford to pay another 6 months. He then says that if I sign up for one month of lessons I could keep the sessions. I said no thanks and got up and left. Looking back I wish I had closed my account then and there. I noticed that the sales rep & trainers didn't greet me as they had when I was paying for the training sessions, I immediately thought. I continued to use this gym with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, but my friends continued to train with me & this facility was close to my house. My friend who had recommended this gym was offered a job in Sacramento and wanted to keep her membership and the trainer program. She was told she would not be able to use her session up north so she used them up before she left. At this point me and a friend kept going to the gym, but we began to noticed that some of the popular cardio equipment with monitors did not work consistently and would regularly be under maintenance. When some of the big equipment broke down it would take almost a month before it was repaired. We also noticed how the locker rooms weren't always cleaned regularly. Over two days I saw the same shower cap and band-aid in a shower stall. When I finally chose to leave this gym I called in to cancel my membership a few days before they charged me for the next month. They told me that the only way I could close my account was to meet with a rep. When I asked to speak to the rep and if there was any way to close my account. I was brushed off and told I just need to come in and meet with them and they worked from 9-6 Monday through Friday. I told them I was not able to meet during those hours as they are when I work and if I could leave them a message. They repeated their scripted response and I realized I was getting nowhere with this person. The next day I got off early. I went in to speak with the rep. I asked to close my account and explained how I had tried to do this earlier in the month. The rep said that they would close the account but I would still be charged for the month since they had not received a cancellation form in the mail or email. Apparently I could have mailed or emailed them a form to cancel the account but their staff couldn't or wouldn't let me know this over the phone and when I asked her about it she simply asked me who told me that and left it at that. While the rep was courteous, she kept repeating that she could not reimburse me for the month and when I pressed her to look at my account more closely kept moving from computer to computer saying that she could not bring up my account since their computers were freezing, all the while they are scanning members key cards as if there is no problem. I don't plan to go back to that gym and hope others don't fall prey to this company."
519,2188297,2017-02-08,1,I have been charge for an account should be canceled few month ago and they said is my fault because I didn't fill up a paper that they never tell me I have to. So I don't have any solution except to pay for something I didn't use it? Beside customer service on the phone and the manager of Somerdale location in NJ have been so rude!!! Worst experience ever!!
520,2149011,2017-01-24,1,"I had the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. PERSONNEL DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CLIENT SATISFACTION. I joined LA Fitness as a new years resolution on Sunday, January 1st. On the 2nd (considered this year as a federal holiday) I engaged in the personal trainer program. As part of the agreement, the person that assisted me said that I was paying for 2 to 3 sessions a week and also that as a courtesy the first session washing to be longer in order for me to meet the personal trainer and get used to the routine. I was also told that the sessions where going to last from 35 to 40 min. I went the first day, and everything was fine. The session lasted 50 min so I did have enough time to exercise. What I wasn't told was that they were going to use two of my sessions for the first day, neither I was told that I was paying for 25 mins session. They scheduled my second class for Wednesday, I told them that I needed to be called to be reminded of the sessions since I wasn't used to the routine; they called right after the schedule session was over and added the session as worked and discounted it from the sessions left. Nonetheless, I schedule for Thursday and the personal trainer couldn't go. First he told me because he had to left his girlfriend at work he was going to go 30 min late and even though I agreed he never showed up and said his car was broken... Really?! We reschedule for next day Friday, and he didn't show up, he said that he forgot to put the alarm clock on time... What type of UNPROFESSIONALISM is this. I certainly got mad and asked for my contract which they barely make you look at and they don't give you a copy once you signed and they said that I had to come back from 9am to 5pm, it was unbelievable.I did went back to look for my contract very UPSET to one close to where I work, and asked for help to get me out of this contract since this wasn't I agreed to pay for, and instead of helping they were acting like piranhas talking bad about the LA Fitness where I signed and getting all the credits, how could an ethical business possibly do that?! WORST SERVICE EVER...!!! I wanted to get out of the contract badly and by the time they finally realized it, the person said ""I'm sorry. Yesterday was the last day you had to claim a full refund. Now you have to pay besides that a 50% of your plan non-used."" I did got pretty UPSET due to his LACK OF DESIRE TO HELP and got even MADDER when I asked for a corporate number. They gave me the first number they came out with that didn't even work. When I read the contract it said if I wanted to ask for the full refund I needed to claim the funds within 3 days after the contract being set up clearly stating excluding weekends and holidays, so basically I thought it was my lucky day, since I got into the contract on a Sunday, which they don't count as a work day. Monday was classified as a Federal Holiday this year leaving Tuesday as the first day of my contract and three days after would have been Friday which it was the day I asked for the cancellation. I felt on my rights to asked for the refund so I called the headquarter at a phone number I found in Google, since apparently no one that works for LA Fitness knows the phone number, DISAPPOINTING, and when I explained them the situation they said that Thursday was the last day and that they couldn't make an exception ""keeping in mind that I WAS CANCELLING IT DUE TO THE HORRIBLE SERVICE I EXPERIENCED''. They said that in order to do so I had to contact the person that subscribed me that they were going to place me in a brief hold... BRIEF HOLD THAT LASTED 3 HOURS AND ENDED BECAUSE I HUNG UP THE PHONE...!!! I called the person I was supposed to talk to and he picked up the phone within 5 mins which make me believe that all the time they just wanted to have me on hold to get me tired of waiting... WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER...!!! When I talked to the person I was supposed to in order to help me claiming my funds instead he was offering me other personal trainers and insinuated that if the problem was that I couldn't afford the payments... ARE THESE PEOPLE SERIOUS?!?! It made me think if I speak well English and Spanish, for an instance I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING MANDARIN.I sent an email to the director of that one with my cancellation form that I found online, because NO ONE HELPS YOU OR GUIDES YOU TO GET OUT. I sent him my complaint and the full picture and he replied that he was going to give me a call on Monday, January 9th, 2017 and as of today Monday 23rd still haven't received his call. DISAPPOINTING...!!! I did send my cancellation also to the address listed on the contract with my complaint on that Saturday and they replied back that my cancellation was process that still they were going to charge me for the rest of the contract. That I didn't provide specific supporting and verifiable documents and that was cancelled voluntarily therefore they were going to charge me 50% of the current remaining balance owed... ARE THEY INSANE?! Im not cancelling it because I can't afford it, or because I quit going to the gym the first week, I cancelled it because of a breach of contract, since I didn't receive the first week what I was told I was going to receive which they were my 2 to 3 sessions, because of the lie that each session was supposed to last 40 min and in fact it was only 25 min, because of the lack of respect the personnel have for clients and the lack of professionalism... I cancelled it because I feel offended with the way they treated me and they still do. It's unforgivable what happened and the way they are still handling it...!!! WORST GYM EVER. DO NOT EVER EVER ENGAGE IN ANY CONTRACT WITH LA FITNESS, AVOID A HEADACHE AND ABUSE!!!"
521,2146452,2017-01-23,1,This place is disgusting. The locker room has more sand and dirt on the floor than the beach. There are dust balls everywhere. The garbage is always overflowing and the walls in the shower are growing mold. Some agency should do something about this. Each time a member complains they state the manager is not in but they will let he or she know. Terrible disease ridden place.
522,2139944,2017-01-20,1,"My story - I am from Long Island N.Y. and they did not properly close an account I signed for and every time I thought it was closed, they said it would be taken care of but failed to give me a receipt. 13 months later I'm trying to get my money returned. They insult me by saying why didn't I get a receipt. That's my fault. Since I didn't get one that I'm the stupid one. Without piece of paper no proof. They tell me I have no case against them again I am the Stupid one, I've been putting up with them for these months trying to get reimbursement for 13 months of auto billing. I was not aware I was being billed because I thought they closed the account 13 months earlier. And I am the stupid one. They got paid almost 600 dollars for services not rendered and for account I thought I closed 2 minutes after It was opened. And because I didn't get receipt I am the stupid one. Not to mention being told by four account specialist they would forward my complaint to VP. I was told they would get back to me. Never did. And finally today told me I was told I'm getting nothing back because I signed their contract and it was my responsibility to ensure a copy of cancelation be obtained from them. Just sharing my pain."
523,2136146,2017-01-18,1,"So I bought the guest privileges for an extra 20$ every month. With the guest privileges, I can bring in any 2 people I want to work out with me. I usually arrive first to workout and my 2 friends will come after me and I'll just have to check them in. But recently they changed their rule and said that I have to COME IN with my friends in order to get them in. I told them, if they're just gonna have us do that, I'll come out of the gym to get my friends and come back in. Then they told me that I won't be allowed to come back in if I do that and also they told me that I can't workout 3 times a day. (I would probably never go to the gym 3 times a day, but I like to have my options! lol) I was confuse and angry. I mean I bought the guest privileges, shouldn't I have the right to bring any 2 guest I want as long as I'm in the gym? They also told me that I'm not allowed to train with other people in the gym and that if I want to have a trainer I need to sign and pay for a personal trainer at LA Fitness. That's bull! LA Fitness is just being selfish. The only reason why I joined LA fitness was because all my friends were in there and now I can't train/workout with them? The first day that I joined LA Fitness, they tried to convince me to sign up for their personal fitness program. I still remember the personal trainer saying to me with an attitude, ""You'll never reach your goal if I'm not training you."" To me, I felt like that was very unprofessional and I took it offensively. He also told me that we can't be seen training with a friend. I made a strong eye contact with him and told him, ""You think I can't do it by myself? Well watch me. I don't need your help. I'm not signing up for this."" I was pissed off. But I shook it off, whatever, I'm just here to work out. Urgh, should have never signed up for LA Fitness."
524,2133059,2017-01-17,1,"When I joined the gym I had a goal for myself. I even signed up for training and I told them only for 6 months. I will add if I feel I want more training. Well I was still getting charged for training and it should have been done November. Well it was kind of funny how my 6 months ended up being 12. Now I will have to pay half of the remaining months left. I knew I shouldn't have joined this gym, but I was talked into joining this one. Training started out good, but pretty soon it's like ""We'll you need to take this pill, drink this drink"" and my calorie count kept changing. Pretty soon my body was all messed up and I was busting my butt at the gym, but nothing was happening. I had no more weightloss, I was working out with the trainer 3 days a week for an hour and taking a class.. Also I went to the gym to get into shape, lose weight and get healthy. Not be stared at by people cause I am overweight and talked about. That went on all the time at this gym, it's like a meat market."
525,2123084,2017-01-13,1,"The Greece club is by far the worst club I have ever been in. Dirty towels on the floor, hair in the lockers and just dirty. But yet you come in and 2 or 3 employees just hanging out at the front desk talking and having a good old time. Not to mention that 4 machines are broke and no plan to fix until March. Pathetic management other clubs are not like Greece. I know 10 people who have or are canceling their memberships."
526,2115905,2017-01-12,3,"The monthly membership doesn't appear to be a problem but they will coerce you into signing up for a personal trainer. And with all contracts, watch out for the fine print. You ARE NOT allowed to cancel at any time so when you get sucked up in the $200 monthly fee in addition to your $29.95 monthly fee, know that you will be paying for no less than 12 months before you can cancel."
527,2097728,2017-01-05,1,For more than a month it seems I'm being called by other LA Fitness locations to renew. Every time I've asked them to remove me from the call list. Isn't this kind of practice illegal esp on my cell #?
528,2095589,2017-01-05,1,"They apparently don't process cancellations, and then blame the consumers for it. My wife canceled her membership at a branch. They deactivated her account, and immediately started spamming her email with offers to return. But they never stopped charging her credit card. Three extra months they charged, at $66 a month. I had to file a dispute with my bank. Then I canceled my account at a branch location. The person said it was done, and I had no more payments. But I called the next month, and what do you know... they never canceled my membership. The manager at the branch even said there was no way to refund my money because he said that I ""didn't cancel properly."" ME! I DIDN'T CANCEL PROPERLY! What the actual **?! I had to put a good on my credit card. Apparently this scam is part of their business model. We need a class action against LA Fitness and they need to go out of business. ** scumbags. They make me sick."
529,2093750,2017-01-04,1,"Where to begin. It all started when I wanted to go gym out and work my physique back to my former glory days. All in the pretty mild days of October and November when the incident took place. I signed up blindly to a membership and PT contract. This is where the nightmare begins. I figured out that I did not need all these added fees on my membership nor my Personal Training due to my circumstances and proceeded to come in 3 days AFTER I signed those contracts. It is IN THEIR POLICY to allow you a full refund for everything if you come in to cancel within those 3 days and submit the paperwork. I came in with my family members to discuss this and thought I cancelled both membership and Personal Training while getting a cheaper membership deal (without those ridiculous fees that I won't be utilizing their benefits). Then a month happened. It is now November. I was expecting a refund for the mistaken charges against my bank account but I was charged additionally another $195 and $43 for contracts I had CANCELLED ALREADY. It hit me and my family really hard that it occurred to us that they did NOT submit the paperwork and allowed it so that we do not get a full refund on the contracts I cancelled for in the first place. I had charges mounting up to $700+ within the first TWO MONTHS. Being a broke college student, this did NOT make my day.I had to come in AGAIN in November and boy, the PTD (Personal Training Director) was absolutely RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL towards my older siblings who are well off with their family and kids. They were APPALLED by the behavior that this guy demonstrated towards us. Not to mention the guy handling my membership? He was never there since that time I wanted to straighten out my contract for membership. Can you believe it? These two are in cohorts to make off with your money. And I imagine reading the other reviews on this site, they are all true and happening in all parts of our beloved America. Employees like that should be burned to the stake. But anyways... Back to Reality.We called corporate later that November night to find out that the PTD LIED to corporate about wanting to cancel my Personal Training contract and the same *probably* happened with my membership too, but I was more focused on the Personal Training at the time. The person at corporate told us to dispute all the charges made against me with my bank - and I did so promptly after we hung up with corporate.Corporate called back to follow up with the complaint I had the night before - and guess who was on the phone... the PTD... it was a conversation call made to my cell phone... (ugh I hate this) the PTD named Frank - he was absolutely rude like I said earlier - making gestures like ""Let me speak to X privately"" and a lot of other bullcrap like ""I believe how old is X again?"" --- I say that gives you no right to allow me to have someone speak on my behalf if I do not know what is going on and should be standard practice when discussing things like this anyways. I confirmed I wanted to cancel completely a full refund on this (at least I was guaranteed this) and I saw receipt emails. This is probably what I should have gotten when I wanted to cancel back in October. My fault but at least I managed to sneak it in the system that I wanted to cancel back then.From what entailed onwards, I patiently waited into December while hearing the various reports from my brother and sister in law that the PTD was really avoiding them and giving them the ""look"" he gave me back then. The membership person who I signed up with (and want to punch in the face -- strangely looks like my old calc teacher in High School) ""left"" the gym. I started to work out exclusively at home. I made a promise that if I had to pay off anything else from LA Fitness I will never return to any gym for another contract until X months passed (as if I was still continuing at the gym).December - I received confirmed about 2 of the 4 charges made against my account. They agreed to refund EVERYTHING on Personal Training. The bank is still working on membership dues charges made against me (although I am starting to doubt whether these other 2 charges will be credited back to my account). I barely used the gym since then, even in those 2 months I had a membership with them then, I did not feel comfortable knowing my contracts were on the line (after reading various reviews like yours on this site and others).Present day - I have a part time job now (only working as needed by my supervisor) so I guess it's fine now. I really want my other 2 charges credited back to me and I would be so happy if it happened. I just graduated from college not too recently and I have to work towards paying off my student loans. But the clincher is that I have barely any money to go off since this incident. It's driving a huge hole in my bank account along with other necessary purchases like food, clothing, cleaning supplies, helping out family, etc. Even if I have to end up paying the remainder of $291.16, it would leave me nothing as I have to pay off my class (I took a job training class in order to get where I am now), loans, and other things. I soon have to take another prep class so I can try to get into grad school so my money is at an all time low. Still debating the 2 charges - hoping it goes well and my bank can take back the charges against my credit card.END OF OBJECTIVE REVIEW. Rant time. These ** employees, Frank and James can get some karma handed to their ** for trying to deceive a honest customer like me. If James (the membership handler at that time) gets his share of the money from me - which I highly doubt is much, can be lost in some accident (blown in the wind, dropped wallet, etc). If he gets a lion share of the money, then ** him. I want to see him lose it on something he'll regret on. Frank, I have his information card when he was ""nice"" to me, but I looked him up and he was using probably a FAKE phone number.None of these LA Fitness Employees who are THIS competent to even work at gyms should go reflect on themselves before karma hits them for a turn for the worse. LA Fitness is where the Devil and his disciples work their black magic on unsuspecting fellows like us. And to the founder of LA Fitness, I hope your rich lifestyle is worth the thousands of people's money you robbed forcibly by telling your employees to be the duplicitous ** they are reputed to be. You can go die in a hole. Do me a favor LA Fitness. Give me back my money you robbed me or face some damaging consequences for the rest of your pathetic existence your gym runs. I will continue to submit these types of reviews on other sites/social media so try me."
530,2093432,2017-01-04,1,I joined the gym in October 2016 & used the gym for the 4:30 body works class only. In December the 4:30 class was permanently eliminated and I was unable to get my membership join fee back. I advised Lauren (a membership management personnel) I was willing to get a prorated amount back but was denied from management. BEWARE before joining that this happened to me. I am now out my initial money.
531,2093189,2017-01-04,1,"I don't know where to start. The gym went from a 10 when it was opened to a zero. I would say about 30% of the Cardio machines are broken all the time, and the rest have zero maintenance and falling apart if not a out of order sign on it. Water from ceiling leaks a few places, the rugs are all stained with sweat, the crowd has turned to very loud, yelling stuff out as they do the free weights. The locker room should be shut down until cleaned up or replaced. Section one of the showers out of 4 showers, one works, and works horrible. It should be condemned!!! If the board of health ever seen this place, I guess they not doing their job. Usually no cold water, all the showers have mold on them, broken tiles, dripping water, hair in the drains, band aids, clothing, paper towels on floor, no shower heads, the sauna is dirty and the wood is broken, locker room is falling apart, front door always has a broken sign on it for months and months. That's just for starters. A friend told me they were going to remodel 6 months ago, still nothing..."
532,2091560,2017-01-03,1,"I wanted to sign up my son for 5 days beyond the visiting period he gets from my signing him on my guest list when I first joined. First, we were given a price of $75 for him and his wife for 2 weeks. But we were told that it could be less in a few days (after the New Year). Indeed, it was more for him alone in a few days. And they try to sell you a trainer right off, as well. I'll join another gym next year."
533,2078606,2016-12-28,1,"This is my experience with LA Fitness on Personal training program. PLEASE DON'T SIGN ANY CONTRACT WITH LA FITNESS. I went to LA Fitness center and gone through the gym premises. Front desk person was suggesting different program. It was fascinating, because I have set the goal to work on my fitness. In the end, he was giving me idea and about personal training and benefit. I don't remember if he mentioned about 12 months contract and breaking conditions. You will think about LA brand name. So In your back of mind you will never think, what is going to come as personal training, when you start this training program. I have started this program and initial session was good with trainer. After few session you will come know, training is not helping or getting any benefits. At this time I don't know about contract and breaking conditions. Finally I have decided to cancel this program and continue with gym. It's really costly more and am not getting that much benefits. I went to center and discussion this with front desk person. Initial he told me wait. I have waited there for 1 hr and after that he come and discussion. He was saying he can't do anything. I need to call their corporate office.Next day I have call to their corporate office. The lady pick the phone. I have explained her my problem and wanted to cancel my personal training program. She suggested following things me: I need to change trainer, check with different center, I need to pay 50% of remaining period. I don't understand. Why do I need to change center? Because I have sign the contract so. Anyway, I thought let's give another changes. I ask her, ""can you suggest me good trainer so that I will get good training and change my mind."" She told me, will arrange my next session. I have waited for 5 days and no one call me. I was disappointed with things. Finally I have decided to cancel and pay my breakage amount and get out from here. After 5 day I have called them to cancel my personal training program. I told them, why I am cancelling this and not happy with program and management. I will go online and give my true feedback.There are ok this negative feedback. He told me I can write my experience. I don't understand about LA brand name and there are list bother about image. Person from corporate office told me, he was sorry about this things happened to me and he will talk to center and try to improve the program. But he is not ready to way-off my contract. If some problem with them, then also client to pay. This is very bad management. I don't understand about LA management. The only way to cancel this contract is showing medically unfit certificate. I/we don't want to do this. Right? PLEASE DON'T SIGN ANY CONTRACT WITH LA FITNESS. If you really are interest, please try for one month. I am 100% sure you will not extended after that."
534,2078402,2016-12-28,1,"LA Fitness has the classic case of big box gym customer service being a bunch of **. I've been a member since 2013, but they are suddenly closing the two gyms near me (for no stated reason). I have 2 months left on a training package that they insist I use or buy back; they will not cancel or refund anything. In addition, the attitude of their employees in person and on the phone is incredibly rude. Corporate customer service refuses to let me speak to anyone in a higher position and lied and said that they can't refund my package for ""legal reasons."" I will be out of this gym as soon as humanly possible and will never return."
535,2071244,2016-12-23,1,Even if you get it in print a price and special offer it will change or be revoked in nearly every instance. If you choose a certain club that club will not be included. If you want courts that is extra. If you want more than one club it is extra. If you want anything it is going to be extra. The gym is great. I love it but dealing with corporate stuff is a living hell. May take weeks if not months. All the while you are paying top dollar and lose first and last payments plus money down.
536,2050190,2016-12-15,1,"I didn't think anything like this could happen in the United States. I trusted that honesty would be enforced with employees & management, but it turns out even corporate makes excuses for the dishonesty at every level. Sick to my stomach that this company exists, especially the more I read reports of people being taken advantage of when they are sick or undergoing some other hardship. Don't sign up with them, not even just a basic gym membership. You think it won't happen to you, but they find a way to take advantage of everyone. This is NOT your normal company where a corporate complaint means something. Your experience means nothing to them... because they get paid regardless.:)"
537,2035703,2016-12-10,2,"I tried to cancel my personal training before. I got a text from a representative at the gym telling me he ""doesn't know what my issues are"". I don't feel it's fair to charge people $600 a month for 6 hours of work. I'm stupid for signing this, but when you have people staring at you... on top of that they lie to you... They told me they would give me 2 months free sessions... which I didn't get. The manager told me 2 free sessions with him... which I didn't get. He said he would help me with a meal plan... which he didn't do. Now I'm stuck with a trainer who goes to the bathroom doing our sessions and doesn't write everything in my training book. Not even 6 hours since sessions are 25 minutes. I feel so disrespected. I work very hard at my job and I do a good job... and I just feel this is not giving me as much as I give. I am downright insulted by this company. $35/month for gym is fair... but their personal training is not worth it. I am now trying to cancel again."
538,2027060,2016-12-08,1,"LA Fitness is quick to enroll you and extremely difficult to get out of the contract. They keep charging you and pretend that you never been asking for a cancellation, keep bouncing you from one person to another and hide behind working schedule of one person or another. The gym itself is sub par, presenting filthy stinky facilities and chlorine-filled pools. Pretty depressing. No idea how they stay in business."
539,2020988,2016-12-06,1,"I opened family membership for me and my son with 200 down and 49 per mo in August 2016. My son used 4 times as 3 weeks later he got a job in Clanton Al and moved. I called up and told Manager to cancel his membership as there were no clubs in his area. She said I had to come down but I told her just had hip operation and offered to send her verification. She said I had to come in and I hung up. I have never been inside until today, 4 months later as my hip is healed. Brian the Manager confirmed they continued to take my son's membership fees out of my account for the last 90 days. I offered to just credit to my account and he refused. Called Corporate and they said they could only credit 1 month. What a joke. I said ""now cancel my membership as well."""
540,1993808,2016-11-23,1,An evil corporation designed on the sole purpose of not servicing any of its customers and leading them through an endless loop of lies and deception just to take your money. Once you are a member they will never let you go. It is really ridiculous that it is almost impossible to cancel your subscription because they won't allow it by phone. They won't allow it in person. It takes ages for them to process mail applications to cancel and they keep delaying and charging month by month. Just completely ridiculous. I told my bank to stop processing any payments and that was the only way I was able to stop my membership. They charge random fees every now and then for no reason whatsoever. The staff has no idea of what’s going on and can charge you additional fees if they feel like it. It took them 4 months to fix the showers that were out of service and they did a half ** job leaving the showers even more disgusting than before. Absolutely rude and obnoxious staff that think they are right and you're stupid. The equipment is extremely old and outdated with many of them always out of service never to be fixed. Hours of operation are stupidly short and the fees are stupid high. The pools are always dirty and FULL of chlorine. Last time I checked it is supposed to be a water pool not CHLORINE pool. The worst corporation I've ever dealt with.

Firstly there was no form online so I go into a branch. Well they only do that Monday through Friday YET they do new memberships on the weekend. After getting the runaround multiple times I cancel my payments. Then the harassment began... 20 calls daily, including Saturday and Sundays. No way to cancel and constant harassing calls. The place on Route 3 in Clifton is filthy and has a high level of thefts. STAY AWAY!!! New York Sports Club is way classier proving that you get what you pay for."

I then called their corporate department to review the situation and they would not help either. They would not provide a refund, even if they made the error, customer service was very poor."
543,1955507,2016-11-05,1,"On July 23rd 2016, I Sat down with Jonathan assistant manager ID # ** at LA Fitness in Port St Lucie West Florida to talk about personal training. I told him I could only work in the mornings as I am a full time employee and full time student. I usually go to the gym at 5 am but have never seen any personal trainers working with anyone that is why I ask him three different times if he was sure that I could get the training in the mornings. He assured me that he was the one who would be working with me and we proceeded to do the contract. The first workout we had together he was late and he never showed up again. I went to the gym the Saturday after and he told me that he got promoted to another gym and his manager has my information and would call me to assign me to another trainer but that never happen. I called LA Fitness on numerous occasions to find out about the training and each time spoke to a different manager who gave me fake names and each time I was told nothing was noted on my account and they would note the account. One manager said his name was Mike **, another said his name was Chris **. I got a call from someone name Ray no last name about two weeks after who said they have resolved my problem and he has a trainer available so I should be at the gym Wednesday morning. I showed up and no trainer showed up. I called repeatedly to ask them to cancel the contract until another time since they cannot accommodate my schedule but they wouldn't and continued to charge my credit card. I called Capital One to block my credit card and I was told that it is better to change the card.I changed my credit card and Capital One gave them access to the new card. I got sick after that and was in the hospital when I got a call from LA Fitness that they need my payment, I told them I was in the hospital. I was told to send them a note from the doctor and they would cancel my account. My husband took the note to them the next day and they took the doctor's note but did not cancel the contract. I have had surgery since then and cannot work out but still the contract has not been canceled. I don't know what else to do."

Regardless that I have my membership pdf document in tow and guest access absolutely not because unless I sign up I must be a Phoenix AZ resident to get even a guest pass however online there is a guest pass for five days free every six months that include a friend but the confirmation letter states it's, ""for you only"" and three times at one club I got so mad I called the desk clerk and two snotty girls ** and was chased out while they said they were calling police. I was offered a made up package by Breon - TWO weeks for 75 dollars each - which went down to 30 dollars each for me and mom which mom angrily declined and no, there was no free guest pass. At another club I was told by two employee/managers I had to sign up with LA Fitness and was ineligible for the conversion scan code because I missed the deadline. A customer I run into told me. His friends from California were also arm twisted to sign up for LA Fitness and were pissed but cough up the money. According to the article AZ Central presented online according to officials all 24 hour Fitness members with all club access are to enjoy 41 clubs in the valley. My contract says I have 450 clubs and I have always accessed these clubs and if you are not a resident of Phoenix they WILL not give you a guest pass as I have been reminded at the Camelback LA Fitness unless I take out a membership because I am from out of town and because I PURCHASED my membership in California I am denied AZ access as told to me by desk clerks and phone conversations with customer service.

Now she has so many clients that in order to get a time that works in my schedule I have be on the computer at midnight on the day those session become available. I am not asking for just one time slot. However, if I do not sign up for a session immediately the only ones available are at 8:00pm at night which does not work very well when I get up at 5am for work. I have reached out to see if I can reduce those two session since I can never get them scheduled and received a phone from the manager but he is never there when I visit the gym. Hoping that they will work with me to resolve the issue but I doubt it. I already have over 10 unused sessions with more accumulating each month."
546,1933199,2016-10-25,1,"Sent numerous cancellation forms, called and spoke to 3 different managers, spoke to headquarters and still nothing resolved. Well I guess the biggest plus is they finally had a competent GM at this location to finally cancel our memberships. My husband is a 100% disabled vet and we could no longer come to the gym as his condition was worsening and we notified them of this on numerous occasions. He just recently underwent 2 spinal surgeries due to injuries sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan. And has been unemployed and bed ridden. We surely could not afford to continue to pay for a membership we could not use anyway. We pleaded with them to please properly cancel the membership and they kept claiming that's what was done. We would get calls from employs trying to update billing info even though our bank never changed and we would tell them to have their GM CALL US THAT WE HAD ALREADY CANCELLED THE MEMBERSHIP MONTHS AGO! But little did we know they kept writing reports saying we would tell them we're not updating and that we want to cancel! Not true at all we said the same thing every time that we already cancelled on many occasions and to let us speak to the GM and they would say they're busy and say they'd have them call us back.Finally the billings stopped and we assumed naturally that they finally got our multiple letters, our phone calls, something. So to our surprise we wake up to 200+ dollars taken from our account from LA fitness. So you can imagine how upset we are, especially with how full our plate already is! Now they are telling me they refuse to refund my husbands money and that we will just have to deal with the outcome. LA Fitness robbed a 100% disabled vet, right after 2 spinal surgeries and during unemployment at his lowest point. As if suffering from traumatic brain injury and severe PTSD, as well as multiple other issues wasn't enough, lets add to it by stealing from someone who has nothing!!!This place is a joke and now I have to find someone to look after my husband while I hand deliver VA DISABILITY FORMS AND A doctors note stating he cant work out! Hes not even allowed to put on his own sock you **! I cannot get over how sneaky and terrible this company is!!! I will make sure I let the world know what scam artist they are at LA FITNESS!!!"
547,1930004,2016-10-23,1,"My wife has been an athlete all her life, and has been going to our Pompano Beach LA Fitness several times a week since it opened this past New Year's. Both of us purchased 2 year memberships at that time. When we purchased the memberships we were told that it was easy to suspend your membership at any time if we knew we were not going to be able to use it for an extended period due to health issues or even business travel. In August my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and will be unable to use fitness equipment for 6-8 weeks per the instructions of her surgeon. So, we asked both our local representative and a corporate rep that her membership be suspended, but were shocked when we were told that there would be a $35 fee to suspend the membership. Since $35 is roughly what 6 weeks of membership is worth, it would turn out that there would be no benefit to suspending the membership. So, in sum, she will be losing 6 weeks of paid membership because of breast cancer.For a business that sells itself as promoting health, it is bitterly ironic that they are unwilling to support the breast cancer recovery of an existing, dedicated client. If they hadn't already pushed all the mom and pop gyms out of business, we'd be taking our business elsewhere. I guess this is the price we all pay for allowing monolithic, faceless, singularly profit-driven businesses like LA Fitness to verge on monopoly. They can even pump us for money when were literally lying down and unable to fight back."

I printed the required document with the included barcode, and I mailed it via certified mail to ensure delivery. On August 22, I received an email confirmation from LA Fitness that my cancellation request had been confirmed. The email stated that my final billing date was July 28. Regardless, LA Fitness continued to bill me 34.99 per month on July 29. Moreover, in trying to resolve this issue, I went over my records and realized they had been double charging me for months. 29.99 and 34.99 each month since February. I contacted them, and I was told it was a membership for someone I do not know. Clearly these charges are fraudulent. I have contacted LA Fitness numerous times for a resolution, but they keep playing phone tag with me and nothing has been done to solve the problem. I want a refund of 34.99 for the continued unauthorized billing of my account, and I want a refund of 29.99 for 9 months for the fraudulent charges on my account. 304.90 total."

My skin was irritated all day, my lips swelled and my black and pink swim suit is now white and gray. I did call customer service and explained what happened. They said they would call me that day. That was 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard a word from them. The women at the front desk have been rude when I swim now and ask if the chemicals are balanced because I don't want any more skin irritation. Any help?"

When you sign up for the membership you can do it from the gym but if you cancel it we can't do it from the guy. We have to send a printed cancellation form to California. I submitted my cancellation form on April but still was charged $42 'til October. When you call them they have the worst customer service. The people are rude, when you ask for the manager they say that they are the manager. Worst worst worst experience."

Now I understand why they do not respond to e-mails. Because they do not care. Kevin was my worst ever experience talking to. Will cancel mine and all my friends membership with LA Fitness.

For weeks I have taken my daughter 2 or 3 times a week to wait in their child center for an hour until day when the manager on duty prompted me to pay 5 dollars today for the service of an hour or 15 per month. When I was telling her that I wasn't aware of those extra charges, that I thought it was included she insisted that I had to pay or leave. I gave her a 5 20 dollars bill and she went to her purse yes her personal purse but she had no change so she never offered to pay with a card or anything. She wanted me out of there asking me to wait aside while she was checking in other customers so they won't have to wait but it was ok for me to get her awful service. Needless to say I asked the number to call corporate and that was even worst since the person I spoke named Kim or Micky or god knows refused to give me her last name. She covered the manager saying how nice of her go to her purse for change since they don't keep change in their store, and telling me with 0 empathy there was nothing she could do to help in the end offering me to go back and go get my 11 years old who was waiting in the car to have her in the day care for today but next time I would have to pay.My daughter refused to go back in so she waited for me in the car for the 40 minutes of class or less since I spent all this time on the phone. Anyway in the middle of the class they sent a guy to tell me several customers were complaining of my 11 years old waiting in the car and That I had to leave. I asked my daughter. Nobody ever spoke to her. She was just reading her book, had no clue. Basically they wanted me out of the gym and they got it! Looking forward to find me another place. :)"

Just had my friend pay for new membership; then later said he couldn't fulfill his promise to me. When I complained he said it was too bad, that his word meant nothing and that I shouldn't of thought about it better myself, was loud in front of people on the front of the gym, and said that I could call corporate and they would not do much either. I called corporate and they only offered to cancel my friend's new membership and even though their employees deceived us, was rude and unprofessional there was nothing they could do. I paid over $1k for the buyout and had the worst experience during my trainings and after I discussed cancellation. This company Does Not care about their customers whatsoever. Employees can do whatever they need to sell. They can treat you like crap after and nothing is done cause they got your money under contract."

558,1858373,2016-09-20,1,"On August 1, I went into LA fitness in Warwick RI interested in hiring a personal trainer. I told the sales person that I was very concerned about finances. The young girl's name was Jesslyn. I believe she was a new hire, because she pulled her sales manager in to assist her. Chris ** began giving me this huge sales pitch and went on the computer locating great deals. I repeatedly told him that I was very concerned about finances and what I could swing financially. I stated ""what can you do for me?"" I asked repeatedly about the cancellation and was told that I can cancel at any time, preferably 10 days prior to the monthly draft being taken out. He gave me a quote of $200 a month, which was good for 1 year and could be canceled it anytime, so he claimed. I figured I could swing that for a few months. I asked if I could take home the contract and look it over. I was told no that it was not a contract, but rather an agreement and once again I could cancel at any time. I was told that the deal only good until the end of the month in order to lock me into that price. I stated clearly that I wanted a female trainer and was verbally guaranteed the SAME female trainer. I stated I wanted a female trainer, because I wanted the opportunity to build a relationship with a trainer who knew my goals, needs and desires personally. Once again I was verbally guaranteed the same female personal trainer. I was asked to sign on an electronic pin pad to seal the supposed agreement. Again I stated is this a binding contract or agreement. I was told that it was an agreement and that I could cancel at any time. I was also asked to initial what was explained to me as minuscule stipulations in the agreement, and was assured that I could have the same female trainer and there would be no penalties. In good faith I signed.Needless to say within the 1st 3 weeks, I went through 3 different female personal trainers. Disgusted and pissed off, I went into the LA Fitness to discuss my dissatisfaction with the GM John **. I explained to John my dissatisfaction. That this is horrible for 200 bucks a month, not the quality I was guaranteed. John stated ""I understand it is like paying a CAR PAYMENT!!"" His exact words. That I can have you work with so and so. I flat out refused and stated that I wanted it canceled. John informed me that I needed to speak with Alan ** the head of the PT Department. Sensing I was going to get the run around I went home and did some extensive research (which I should have done prior to even joining LA FITNESS). What I discovered was horrendous business practices and individuals who had the same nightmares and complaints as I am experiencing now. The following day I went into LA Fitness with my husband and spoke to Alan ** personally. Knowing the nightmare that others have experienced with this company, and what we may be up against, my husband and I explained to Alan that we currently are faced with financial hardship (which we are recent cutbacks at work environment to avoid layoffs) and cannot afford the $200 a month. ""What can be done for us? What can you do to help us out?"" Alan ** then stated, ""Don't sweat it or lose sleep over it. You need to call Corporate Office personally and send out a certified letter explaining financial situation."" As a consumer the mere fact that I have got to jump through hoops to cancel at my dissatisfaction is completely LUDICROUS. Alan ** then stated that once he receives a call from the Corporate Office following the reception of my certified letter and a request he put in for cancelation of my training he would ok it. Well it has been a back and forth tirade with this company. I received a call from a Diane ** from Corporate. She claims that in order for me to cancel the ""CONTRACT"" which was explained to me as an agreement when I signed up, that I would need to come up with the remaining 50% as a buyout. THIS was NEVER EXPLAINED to me when I signed the agreement or contract. Whatever the hell it may be. When I explained to her what Alan stated to me regarding canceling the contract she asked. ""Who?"" At the time I did not have Alan's last name. On the website he is listed as Alan **. I explained this to her and she then responded that this was never told to her. It has been an absolute nightmare. I am literally losing sleep over this situation. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES would I RECOMMEND this company to anyone. The CUSTOMER SERVICE is DEPLORABLE. Their practices need to be stopped in order to protect the consumer."

Today in the Levittown, NY club, they refused to remove the charge saying that the computer was frozen and that corporate was unavailable to help me or call me and that it was my problem to remove the charge. When I stated my legal rights as a consumer, she still would not help me. When I left the LA Fitness Club, a large built man from the club followed me to my car and threatened me to roll down my window. I refused and he said he was going to ""take care of me,"" and he took down my license plate number. I filed a complaint with the police and am getting a lawyer. Consumers should not have to feel threatened because they make a decision to modify an agreement that they have a right to modify. Their behavior has been downright illegal."
562,1840490,2016-09-13,1,"Worst cancellation experience I've ever had. I try canceling my membership a couple times. First time I walked in and they said they couldn't cancel it because the manager wasn't there. I called in the following day and they said the manager was there but he would not be able to cancel over the phone that I had to walk in. I was at work so during my lunch break I drove there and spoke to the staff that I had talk to over the phone and she said I was good to go that my membership had been cancelled that all they needed me was to walk in and that I was going to see another charge on my account but that it was going to be refunded. I received no email or receipt and surely a month after another charge. I gave them another call and they said I needed to come in and speak to the manager because they had no records of me canceling. I walked in and I received the same story and that the best thing he could do was cancel it at the moment and refund me the one month I had been charged a couple days before. I was so angry I told them just to cancel it, that I didn’t need a refund out of courtesy. Why is it that I signed up online and I can't cancel online or over the phone and when I tried to do it in person I didn't get a good experience out of it. There is no contract so it shouldn't be hard to cancel online or over the phone. The managers are usually there Monday-Friday 9 am-5 pm which is the time most people are at work. I will never again be a member of LA Fitness until they fix this issue and they stop screwing people over. We leave in the internet era and it's unbelievable that to cancel they give you the runaround. Hopefully we as a group could make a difference and drive this company to fix this issues."

For months now I have been under financial stress and have had to borrow a lot of money to make rent and utilities. I recently switched to a international bank with online banking so I could keep track of my money better and discovered that I've been charged $135 a month since February for PT sessions I didn't sign up for or use. The company, who had my signature from my membership agreement form either photocopied it, forged it, or tricked me into signing something hidden that I never read, because they have my signature on the forms for the PT sessions and won't refund my $1,080 or stop the withdrawals until the end of the year cycle.

It happened before where I was billed for $29.00 and billed 2 weeks later for an additional $29.00. After the last auto pay was done, I called in to cancel my services but they do not allow cancellations online or through the phone so I had to physically stamp and mail in a form (even though you can get the form through the cancellation option online which isn't actually a cancellation option but you have to print it out and mail it in physically). So I did mail it in and received a cancellation e-mail. However, I was billed again another $29.99 as they attempted to withdraw from my debit card on file. I called in to ask why was I still being billed when I already cancelled - they said because I still need to be billed for the month of August. I stated that I already paid for the first and last month's billing and why do I still have gym privileges till October. The manager I spoke to said my last month falls on Sept, so my gym usage doesn't cancel until October. I got upset because I said ""That doesn't make sense. Why couldn't you apply the last month to be the August that I cancelled?"" He said it doesn't go by usage and wouldn't refund me the $29.99 even though I haven't been using the services and have been billed every month since then. I'm very disappointing in the greediness of their business. As an U.S. Army veteran I moved to the VA Gym which was more convenient for me. Their customer service was awful and they will still continue to bill me for the $29.99 which is more important to them than the hundreds of dollars I already paid.

I did stopped by one time (around May 2016) to ask for price and took a look around the gym. They have indoor pool that I have interest in but didn't sign up because I had bad experience with them before regarding cancel membership. LA fitness model of business is sale!!! I felt pressure of sale by the way they make sure you sign up the same day. I walked out to think about it. I came back yesterday 08/26/2016 and wanted to use a guest pass to make sure I like the gym and give the LA fitness another chance to have me as member for a long long time but the Asian young man at first gave me the guest pass (he is still pressure me about sign up) and then 1/2 hour later approach me and then said ""The pass is invalid because you have been here before and asked about membership."" He implied that I lied about never been here before and either sign up or pay $15 to use the gym. I said I did stopped by to ask but never use the guest pass and would like to try out the gym. He said: ""It doesn't matter. You said you never been here before but you did."" He is so rude as a young man with starter job like him. As customer service salesman I don't think he will get any further in life. I am a pharmacist manager in retail pharmacy that dealing with lots of customers and has been working with a lot of young people and I always encourage my staff be kind and helpful in order to grow personally and the business grow will follow with your kind wisdom. LA fitness will lose me forever. I will never set my foot in their gym. LA fitness need to look around their competitors. They should walk in Life Time Fitness or Tumbleweed Recreational Center to see how Nice and Kind customer service at those place."
571,1808701,2016-08-27,1,"I started at LA fitness with Regular multi-state access membership $200 initiation, $24.99 first month and $24.99 last month (pro-rated). But I had to move to Tampa, FL for onsite job for 5 months. There was only signature club where I live. I called corporate office and they upgrade me to signature and increased my monthly payments to $44.99 from $24.99. They charged me $67 out of which $44.99 is this month and $20 is last month (pro-rated) since I only paid $24.99 as last month (pro-rated). I moved back to my town and I called to put me into the regular fitness club where they used charge me $24.99, also requested for $20 refund as my last month (pro-rated) would come down to $24.99. They say that's not possible. When they are able to charge me extra $20 when I'm upgrading, why it isn't possible for them to refund $20 if I'm downgrading? This company would collapse very soon. I see no one is satisfied. They don't have long-term customers. Everyone is dissatisfied. PLEASE DON'T JOIN AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you are committed, you can get in shape and stay fit going to other fitness clubs at the same time save lot of money."
572,1805599,2016-08-25,1,Charged me more months after I canceled. Biggest rip-off ever. Cancelled 3 times. Couldn't get it in writing. It's been 3 months. Cannot get them to stop. Called corporate. When I asked for manager they hung up. Don't use these people. You will be sorry. Worst employees and worst company!
573,1799053,2016-08-23,1,Very difficult to cancel and not helpful customer service. They are aware that you will never come back so they try to squeezed as much as they can in membership billing fees from you. Good luck to anyone that uses auto billing with this company.
574,1798315,2016-08-23,1,"I worked as a Personal Training Counselor at an Illinois location for less than a week (the reason as to why is coming). I took this position because I am interested in fitness and with a degree in Kinesiology, a gym would be a perfect fit. I get to talk to people about fitness and health all day and with some individuals I get to talk to about training and see if they're interested in purchasing a package to help them. I am an honest person, and if I don't think training is the right fit for you, or I think your money could be spent in a more beneficial way, I am going to come out and say it. Also, just because you don't buy training, doesn't mean I'm not going to still help, I can still talk to you about fitness and explain what you could do to help you more or maybe help debunk a myth or two at the very least. I am NOT a pressure sales person, working out should be fun and not forced, it should be knowledgeable and rewarding, not to mention honest... this place is the complete opposite!Let me start by saying this, they will screw you out of money any way they can, especially with lying to you! Their fitness assessment is scripted, not sure if this is every location but it was with mine. They will change it up slightly with every person to make it sound personal and tailored to each person... It's not at all tailored. Now not only is it scripted, it's mostly lies. I'm not kidding, I was shocked at how much of it was crap. Coming from a 4 year degree in Kinesiology and being certified in training twice, it was difficult to lie about something I spent a long time studying about. They make it sound like you HAVE to train with them in order to gain benefits, they make it sound like you NEED them. Not EVERY single person needs training, not ALL individuals benefit from it.Apart from the lying at the beginning of the assessment, now comes the workout, which isn't a huge problem but their philosophy is basically beat up the potential client for 20 minutes so they think holy crap I'm going to be hurting after 30 minutes if this is how I feel after 20. One thing about fitness is that not every client needs to be beat up, some like that difficult workout, but some clients have injuries or other medical problems that need to be accounted for. I have background in this area so I can do anything from beating the hell out of someone to rehabilitating an injury or altering workouts for other health complications and not caring if the client even breaks a sweat. Personal Training Counselor's are not required to have ANY fitness background, all they need to know is how to beat someone up.Lastly about the fitness assessment, they will try their hardest to talk you into signing up, including throwing in free training, dropping the price, everything they possibly can. Don't sign up, go to a different gym where they don't pressure you. They don't care about health, all they want is your money. Your knowledge isn't what get's you to rise up in the business, it's strictly how much money you can make them... literally.Now, let's go back to the top where I mentioned how I worked there for less than a week and my reason would come. My reason was stated above. It took me less than a week to figure all this out. One day was basically training (I didn't pay attention to what I was memorizing at first). The company is so screwed up and twisted, structure is a mess, no one works together. Fitness assessments are lies and scripted. Security isn't even accounted for, aka there is no form of any security at all. The whole company is based on how much money can we make, not who can we help and how can we change lives for the better."
575,1798093,2016-08-23,1,"Tried to cancel our membership 3 months ago. They told In order for them to cancel our membership I should go to the gym and cancel which is what I did. I thought they won't gonna charge my card since then, pissed me off they keep charging my card without me knowing and they telling me I didn't cancel the membership. L.A. FITNESS Only wants your money seriously and add to that, their gym is so filthy."
576,1791526,2016-08-19,1,"If corporations run contest on who is the worst, LA Fitness will definitely win the first place. They are the worst. They have no mercy. They rip people off."
577,1791451,2016-08-19,1,The personal training manager at the Flagler location in Miami was extremely rude to me when I came in to discuss hiring a personal trainer. She acted if she was not interested in selling me personal training hours at first and then when I told her I was a doctor her eyes lit up and she was then very interested once she knew she could make a good commission from me. She then began to make me offers for more training hours than I was asking for and saying that she could get me discounts that I verified were not available. I do not recommend visiting this location and I will be filing a complaint with the personal training manager's boss.
578,1789570,2016-08-19,1,"So after the complimentary personal training, I decided to sign it up to try it for a month. However, the sale representative never ever told or mentioned the term ""year"" or ""twelve months"" in the whole conversation. Also, he kept mentioning that I would be able to cancel the contract whenever I wanted it. Therefore, I fell for the trap, and signed the ""1 YEAR"" contract without noticing it. What's even shameful was that he never showed me the actual contract which he should've turned the PC screen, and showed it to his customers, so there's no way to get reminded in the entire signing process. After all those exhausted training and signing process, I went back and opened my email. I found that it was actually a 1 YEAR CONTRACT. I went back to gym on the next day in the morning, and after talking to the employees at front desk, one of the helpful front desk lady decided to cancel the contract for me. However, one of the sales representative found out, and tried to ""delay"" the process by saying he would handle it. He took me to the side and asked me to wait the sales representative that ""helped"" me sign the contract. After the long 40 minutes wait, the guy finally showed up and kept asking me why I wanted to cancel the contract. He kept using some words like achievement, goals to persuade me to keep the damn 1 year contract. Nonetheless, I was too sick of this and wanted it to just cancel the contract. The guy eventually said ""even after 30 days, you can cancel the 1 year contract by changing the billing information, and put something like a prepaid debit card on it. That way LA Fitness would not be able to charge me because there would be no money in that card."" It is hard to believe this is coming from a sales representative. At the end, I told him I really just wanted to cancel the contract, and he gave me one of the most ridiculous excuses. He said, ""I could not cancel the contract. Only the manager could cancel it, and he won't be here this week, so you can come back on Monday."" This excuse would be great if this contract was signed a month ago because there are only 30 days to cancel a 2500 dollars worth contract. However, the contract was just signed yesterday, so there was literally no reason that he could not cancel it. Anyway, I wasted 2 hours waiting and talking with this guy, so I decided to go home first. On the next day in the morning, I just went back to that helpful front desk lady, and she literally only spent like 5 minutes to cancel it for me. Avoid free complimentary personal training session that they give you when you become a member. If you are going to cancel the contract, try avoiding all the sales representative including the guy who was doing the signing process for you because most likely he would give you excuses and won't cancel it for you. If you want to cancel the contract, try asking the front desk employees who are using computers to assist you, not the guy who is scanning the bar code."
579,1789240,2016-08-19,1,"It was the worst experience I ever had!!! I let my son at their kids club while and he was injured twice. He fell on the wet floor and after that he fell from a tree from their playing area. He wasn't able to walk for 2 days and when they announced me the lady who was babysitting was smiling at me. I was pissed and I called to cancel my membership and I asked for my initiation fees back and of course I asked to be reimbursed for the month that I already paid. First the manager agreed over the phone but when I went there they denied telling me that they will try (not for sure) to reimburse me. I was frustrated because of their attitude and they filed an injury report without my knowledge. When I asked to see the report they refused of course. It was my fault because I shouldn't leave my son in their hands. They have uncertified personal. They don't care about their customers at all. I know it's all about money but if you wanna make business you need to respect your customers. For your kid’s safety, stay away and pay as much as it needs for their safety. I am happy my son is better now and I am thinking it could be worst."
580,1785937,2016-08-18,1,"When I signed up I was informed that ""VIP Guest"" members can be added by me at anytime for a 6-day trial membership. The requirement was simply first name, last name and phone number. I explained to the associate that I did not want sales staff calling any guests I referred and was assured that phone numbers were ONLY used for verification purposes. I signed a guest up several weeks ago online and she has been receiving multiple sales calls every day since then. She has asked them to stop calling and they won't. I emailed a complaint last week and received the following response: ""This is not the experience we want anyone to have. I have passed this information to the Membership Director for the Irvine- Crossroads location for his immediate attention."" I have never received a phone call but my friend continues to get sales calls."
581,1783333,2016-08-17,1,"Unless you want to have a gym membership with LA for the rest of your life, you probably shouldn't join. I went in in-person multiple times to try to cancel the membership. They told me I had to come in before 6 pm so that the manager would be there, but even when I did he would always have ""already left"". When I complained about this, the employee offered to I'M a manager at another location and have him cancel it for me. I confirmed with that employee that the membership was cancelled. Low and behold, I get a charge for the next billing cycle. This is in addition to the extra month they charge you for at the beginning of your membership. When I talked to corporate later about a refund, they told me that since I didn't have any proof that I had come in to cancel in person, they would not refund the money. Because of course it is my fault that I was lied to! Unbelievably poor customer service. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with him while he kept coming up with excuses that didn't explain what had happened (i.e., you didn't cancel early enough). This individual also lied to me. I told him the week I had cancelled the membership since I didn't have the exact date recorded, and he told me that he had record of me coming in that Sunday, which I know I didn't because of another commitment that day. They will clearly do anything to get out of giving you a refund!"
582,1773808,2016-08-13,1,They will not let you out off contract even if you have a valid reason like in my case a doctors and physical therapist note to avoid strenuous exercises after a motor accident!!!
583,1759687,2016-08-06,1,"Filthy, dirty, watered, staff does not order the weights at the end of the day, bathrooms dirty men, delays in arranging apparatus and broken things in the end is a disaster, that season members come and go, need to have another gym to move, it's horrible. It does not have star."
584,1755814,2016-08-04,1,"When you join this club, you are obligated to pay the initiation fee (typically around $100) as well as the first and the last month of your membership. Come cancellation, they make it very difficult, and still charge you even though the last month fee had already been paid upon joining. As far as cancellation process is concerned, online cancellation is not an option (you can join online, but not cancel). Instead, you are required to print out the form and MAIL it (!!!) to their PO Box, the content of which, I dare to predict, is barely checked. As an alternative, you may bring that form to any location and speak with the Operations Manager there. He or she is strictly a 9-5 person. Thus, if you go to the gym before or after work, the Ops Manager by design is not going to be there. And, at many locations, he is actually nowhere to be found past 2:30 pm either. It seems that LA Fitness learned nothing from the class action that they lost in 2013, and they continue billing past the cancellation. When you finally deliver your cancellation notice, you will learn that you are actually still stuck with them for up to two to three months. First, Janie ** in the corporate office will explain that the charge for the month in which you canceled, and the month immediately following it, is valid. This is because she either did not have the time to ""process"" your request, or it did not reach her, or because you played cat and mouse with the Ops Manager for too long. All your fault. And second, the last month had been pre-paid so long ago that you likely don't even remember it, and now it is added to your relationship with the gym you are trying to leave."
585,1753216,2016-08-03,1,"I have relocated so I decided to cancel my membership with LA Fitness. They are not making this easy for me this time as well. It had already happened twice before. I explained that there is no LA Fitness anywhere near me now (within 200 miles at least) and I currently don't have access to mail. They refused to cancel my membership because Pat (corporate helpline) over the phone said they can't help me if ""this is something I choose not to do"". I am going to stuck in the membership for another month or two just because they refuse to help me exploring other options and they don't see the meaning of customer service. Last time when I tried to cancel my personal training membership with LA Fitness, I was told that I need to do it in person with a manager. So I went into the gym at the time they told me the manager would be there. I went there 5 times and was told 5 times the manager happened to be away. I feel that they didn't want me to cancel and I kept that membership for 2 more months paying out of my own pocket because I can't cancel when the manager is not there. Interesting thing is that the front desk in the end helped me cancel it after I insisted him calling the manager right at the moment. He was able to cancel it for me after all those time I wasted coming to the location when I was told the manager would be there while the front desk has every access to help me with it. They wasted my time and money.I wouldn't think that cancel a gym membership would require a favor from friend to print out my form and send it in for me, but it seems that I have to ask now. Or they will just keep taking my money. LA Fitness tries very hard to drag the timeline and let me pay even only a month more of membership fee. And it's not the first time."
586,1748947,2016-08-02,1,"More than five days without A/C working and corporate has not done anything about this issue. I emailed corporate with over 15 pictures of damaged equipment and over 10 issues and all I was told by ""Bryan"" was ""thank you we will look into it."" What is there to look into? I've just done inventory on your gym, listed all of the issues and you have to ""look into it""? Associate manager mentioned this club gets an average of 8 new memberships a day, but you can't fix damaged equipment. You don't have enough funds to staff your gym, so you overwork your employees?? What the hell is going on?"
587,1748320,2016-08-01,1,"They don't clean the showers. Drains clogged with hair. Always have to request clean towels because they're usually not washed well.

588,1728409,2016-07-22,1,"In order to cancel you have to mail a form you get from the gym and wait 2-4 weeks for it to be processed. The gym manager who told me that and handed me the form failed to tell me that he can cancel the membership from his end. When LA Fitness denied receiving my cancellation form, A friend told me that the gym manager can cancel it. The gym manager kept promising to do that month after month without actually doing it. I continued to pay for membership until I asked my bank to not approve any transactions by LA fitness. I asked them for a refund for the months I didn't attend after requesting membership cancellation but they refused saying they don't have a record of me canceling my membership."
589,1724482,2016-07-20,1,"I was a cycling instructor for LA FITNESS for over 2 years just as a hobby because I love fitness. I used to work out as a member at the ** location in the mornings with 2 friends with my 2 guest pass who later became members at that location. We began meeting at that location around December til about April 2016. When we began working out there we were being harassed and bullied by a trainer named Ozzie. He would come into our area and take our equipment and claim that equipment is for personal trainers even if he is not using it. Several times we complained to the corporate company of the harassing and the need for more equipment that paying members could use. That gym is always a disaster a total mess. I have all the complaints and responses. At one point I was referred to see Rosemary the facility manager who in turn treated us like crap and didn't even listen to the complaint. I got very upset and I quit as an instructor that day. When I came back to become a member that afternoon with my husband I could not get a membership because Rosemary put in my file that I was training which was a lie but even if I was she didn't have any proof to put that lie on my file. My husband was able to get a membership but I couldn't for 90 days is what Rosemary put in my profile. I contacted the company again and I was reassured that Rosemary's boss/regional whatever would contact us and clear up this matter. That was in April 2016 and no one ever contacted any of us. I got a new membership with LA fitness 2 weeks ago. I purchased access to all locations and I added guests to my membership. I go to the 137/Miller location in Miami 3 times a week. I went to the Miller location and after I checked in the front desk guy came to me and said I had to leave because it says in my profile that I can't go to that gym. He made a scene and even told me that if I don't like it I should go to 24-hour fitness!!! I naturally snapped. I got angry and left but before saying some great things. After sending another complaint to corporate, the regional ** Juan ** that never contacted me back in April and now it's the end of July finally called to tell me that because of the scene that my membership is cancelled. He didn't even listen to the complaint. The bottom line LA fitness will never listen to your complaint because they don't care. They hire unqualified people to do work that requires customer service skills but they don't have any skills all the way to corporate. Once you become a member they could care less what your concerns are. The managers are disrespectful as well as their front desk down to the cleaning people who harass you if you bounce the ball in the gym or jump rope! It's a shame to see such a big company to continue to shaft people into thinking they are purchasing a membership that is worth having. Now I'm out $164 for 18 days of gym access because I just bought it July 2 and paid first last and down payment. Just beware if you decide to become a member it's really not worth it.Updated 7/26/2016 - After all my complaints my membership was revoked by some guy name Juan ** whom I have never met but put a lie on my profile. I got angrier because I just spent 164 and I had not even used 17 days of my membership. The next day I got a call from the Regional whatever which I will say he was very nice and heard all my complaints but he wasn't really listening because he claimed he couldn't overturn whatever Juan ** did so he really wasn't a Regional Anyone but he did refund me some of my money back which I am very grateful. But if I owned LAF and I had management revoking a membership I would want a real good explanation. Revoking my membership because the member (me) knows more exercise than the paid trainers that they have and they feel threatened. Mr Regional said I was a threat to their trainers because I am so organized and I work out with other people in my party, people that I myself referred to the gym. Basically what he said revoking me will eliminate the threat instead of getting rid of the crappy staff. My hubby also cancelled his membership and we are signing up to another gym and guess what the 4 other new memberships I referred to LAF in less than 4 months are also cancelling their memberships and following me to the other new gym I'm going to."

It is a breeding ground for germs since people sweat so bad and they rarely clean in there. This is not Gold's. They charge high prices and should be able to afford cool temps. Also there is no changing room for woman. Someone can easily take video or pics of naked woman and post them somewhere. I find this dangerous!"

Besides the AC at this packed small room doesn't work properly, there is a big fan that is also broken. I complained with the staff several times about the fan/heat, all they do is making jokes! The whole gym is dirty, broken equipments stay broken for way too long. (15/20 days!) Unbelievable how they just don't care about their members. I have to travel 9 miles to another location, despite living half mile from this Coconut Creek gym. My friends ALL left too!"

With, 1 child leaving the area (school) and not able to utilize the membership I attempted to transfer only to discover, the sales person lied and corporate will not do anything to allow my other child to attend the facility.

593,1700848,2016-07-09,1,"I signed a contract for 1 year of 3 times a week of personal trainer. They told me that the trainer was a kinesiologist who was experienced in working with older clients. During my second training my knee got injured. I elevated and iced it and got a knee brace. I went back for two more sessions and asked that my training not include exercises that would stress my knee. However, that did not happen. I continued to have problems with my knee. X-rays showed bone fragments in my knee and my doctor gave me a note saying that I needed out of this contract. Now, I have to have surgery to remove the fragments. LA Fitness told me when I signed the contract that they would buy back 50% of the sessions. I went there and asked to do that knowing I was going to lose a lot of money. However, when I went to do this, they told me that I could do that but lose the remaining 50% of the sessions - since I was cancelling the training contract - I would just lose these sessions at the end of the month. This means that I do not even get to keep the 50% of the remaining sessions for which I paid. Since this was not explained to me I am furious. This seems like very poor business ethics and even worse customer service. I would like to know if anyone has success fighting LA Fitness in these matters."

I called LA Fitness on July 1st to cancel the services for my personal trainer and to use my remaining 8 since I already paid for it. I was told that the operations mgr was not in, then I went in on the same day to try and cancel the services and was told that only the operation manager was not in and the member service rep was not able to cancel. He asked if I could call back on July 5 and speak with the operation manager. I called and spoke with Emily, explained to her that I called and came into the fitness to cancel my training services and stated that a member service rep could have assisted with my cancellation. But clear that was a lie because the member service rep stated that they could not cancel the service. Emily did not want to help. She seemed to be annoyed of the fact that I asked for a refund for services that I am not going to use. Called corporate, spoke with Jodi, explained to her the situation. She saw what I was talking about, explained to her that 4 people from LA fitness stated that I could get a refund and I tried cancel last week and they still would not honor my refund. As soon as my eight sessions are over I will not return to LA Fitness."

Later in March 2nd week I requested a cancellation of my membership with same guy Victor. He said, since facility has not started yet, therefore my membership information is not in system yet, therefore he cancelled it on copy of contract paper by signing it. Business did not open until April 1st week. Later in April end when I checked my credit statement I saw LA Fitness has charged my credit card. I went to Victor and explained him the situation. This time, he checked in the system and confirmed that someone entered my application in the system and therefore I am being charged. This time he promise he is going to take care of cancellation and I do not need to anything from my end. This time he kept the copy of contract on which he signed cancellation last time. When I checked my credit card statement again in May end, I found another charge on my credit card. I contacted the facility immediately and asked for explanation and they said it's not cancelled in the system yet. To this date (6/14/2016), I have been charged $128 for a membership which I requested to be cancelled before Business started on April 1st week. Now, the facility and corporate is refusing to refund my money. Their representative supposed to update the record on time which he did not. Now, I am being told it's my fault that the information is not update in their system. Am I supposed to that? Or is it my fault their representatives do not have proper training. It took them 10 min to offer a membership and now taking forever to cancel my membership and resolve the case in appropriate manner. The height of frustration happened when the corporate supervisor Justin offered me 50% refund of my own money and acted like he is doing a favor to me. This is my hard earned money and I won't let cheap ** like you to take it from me for nothing. I have contacted my attorney and preparing a case against the facility and corporation."
598,1646574,2016-06-13,1,"I signed up for a membership at the Stamford CT location ONLY because I was told I got a free two-week trial, and that I could get a full refund after that if I wasn't satisfied with the gym. I only used the membership TWICE and decided to cancel since I really didn't like how dirty the location was. Prior to the two weeks expiring, I spoke to the operation manager and general manager who told me they couldn't process a refund. The GM was very rude to me and said I had been milking the membership. Meanwhile I had only been there a few times and honestly didn't like the fitness center at all. They kept saying they would look into it and do the best they could but when I didn't hear back from them I contacted the GM again Monday 4/11, where I was told they couldn't give me a refund and there was nothing they could do to assist me.Since then I have been contacting LA Fitness Corporate who has not been helpful at all, saying they will investigate but never calls me back. I wasted more than $200 on this because of unprofessional staff and false promotions. I will continue to take this case further since I still haven't seen my money and it's been almost 3 months. DO NOT BECOME A MEMBER HERE."
599,1641621,2016-06-10,1,"They have the worst in person and on the phone customer service possible. I have been a member for 5 years and they are consistently rude and incompetent. I could document all my problems with them, but it would take too long."
600,1639866,2016-06-09,1,"My daughter signed up for LA Fitness in her senior year of college. After graduating I was still getting billed each month on my credit card. I called to cancel her membership and was told I couldn't do this over the phone. Since my daughter is active duty with the Marines, it wasn't practical for her to travel to LA to cancel. When I explained our situation, she said I needed to talk to their Operations Manager who only works M-F, 9-5. I pointed out it was Thursday 3:00 PM and I'd like to be connected. She then told me he had left early for the day and was unavailable. I'll protest these charges through my credit card company."
601,1637523,2016-06-09,1,"I am the only user on my account. To make the story short, my husband paid CASH!!! for 24 session of personal training as a gift. But for some reason the sale rep made my husband sign some papers, not realizing it was a 12 month contract for my account. He is not authorize to sign anything for me, those are not my signers. I contacted the sales rep, manager wanted to cause issue, call Corp. Everyone said the same thing, they can't give you anything better than ""I will get back to you with 24hr."" No one ever did. This has been on going for a week. I will take things into my own hands. This company and their staff is a bunch of low life Joke. Where is all the higher authority offices or there is none. What a shame for a great business but horrible unorganized management team. I am a business owner. I don't have time for this, but truly upset and aggravated. Evidence on YouTube. After this the manager approach and wanted him to delete the video and threatening him. Stating that he can't leave the location until he deleted the recording. They tried to lay their hands on him, he know the law. He call the cops, and of course they change their voice. My husband got the sales rep/personal trainer to verbally authorize the recording beforehand."
602,1628100,2016-06-04,1,"There are too many gyms around to warrant signing up to this one! I was visiting and bought a month's pass. I also signed up for 13 x 25 minute personal training session at over $700! Unfortunately I could only use 5 of those sessions as I was injured during the 5th, so much so that I will have to be under medical care for the next year and am at risk of cancer. I got no help with my injury, I was treated with extreme rudeness by the personal trainer director and I certainly did not get any money back for the unused session. I called customer service, who just ignored me. Stay well away! They sign you up in the space of 5 minutes, you sign your life and money away! Read the small print - do not sign the injury waiver! There are plenty of other good gyms around."
603,1621215,2016-06-01,1,The LA Fitness on Pleasant Hill Rd. Sauna stay out of order. The gym don't keep the paper towel stock therefore we can't wipe down the equipment. The corporate office make sure they get their money every month so it would be greatly appreciated if the members have everything they're paying for.
604,1619187,2016-05-31,1,"So, I had an unfortunate event that struck my family. I had to then stop attending LA fitness and my training. When I tell you they make it sooooo DAMN difficult to do such. You cannot do it over the phone? then they told me call member id to pay off my training contract, so I call then they tell no they can only do it by credit card. Like are serious talk about a runaround. One tells you this then the other tell you something different. It is TERRIBLE customer service. I may have considered joining back after things settled down. But after going through this hassle I will NEVER go to another LA fitness. Like my god I am trying to pay y'all and they make impossible. It is extremely poor service all around. Not to mention way over price now that I know what others pay at different gyms. I am truly disappointed."
605,1613358,2016-05-27,1,"I have been a gym rat for thirty years at various clubs in the West Hills of Pittsburgh. I have been a member at the LA Fitness at Settlers Ridge in Pgh. PA since March 2012. I am what you would call a regular. In fact one of the trainers commented about me being a ""trouper"" yesterday, since I am there every day. I assure it has NOTHING to do with the positive environment created by the staff. They reopened this week after a refit. I have yet to hear ONE positive comment. I have had people I don't know complain to me, but I regress. I started using wellness balls about 10 years ago. When I joined LA, one of the things I looked for were Wellness balls. They had several. Over time they disappeared. I asked the operations mgr if they could order more. This was maybe two years ago. To my surprise, delivery took about six weeks. I never understood why they couldn't take money out of petty cash, go to Dick's, and buy a couple, but I guess they had to go thru the corporate maze. I use wellness balls to stretch and have done so prior to and over the time spent at LA fitness. After the refit, the staff decided to prohibit member usage. Only the members who pay for a personal trainer can use them. So far I have not seen anyone using them, we had two, and I see them in the corner of the training corral. I asked if we would be getting more and why we can't use them anymore. I was told since LA had to replace them so often we would have to wait. I sincerely believe these two are the same ones ordered upon my request so I don't know what that means! I see the refit, and can only imagine the cost. To be told they are too expensive would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic. Apparently the refit catapulted the club to a new location on the corner of Cheap Alley and Clown Way! Like I mentioned, I have been a gym rat for over thirty years and have left clubs for various reasons. One place didn't run the heat in the winter or the A/C in the summer and I thought this was as bad as it gets but the club now located at the intersection of Cheap Alley and Clown Way trumps it all!"
606,1608165,2016-05-24,1,Being the fit person that I am I have experience with different gyms. I decided to sign up with LA fitness because of the location (5 mins from my house). To start off I got my membership around January 2016 because I heard friends and saw a few posters near streets around saying they have a promotion with no starting fee. Basically I would have to pay the first and last month only. I gave them a call to ask about that promotion and the sales guy told me that promotion ends that same day I called (it was too late for me to go and open an account). I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said I could. He went ahead and took all of my personal information through the phone. I knew it didn't sound right to open a membership through the phone but because of the promotion I disregarded that. The next day I went to the gym and took my fiancé with me and he spoke to a sales person and told my fiancé that was the last day for that promotion! So I was being lied to from the beginning. I disregarded that because I wanted my fiancé to benefit from that promotion. Fast forward to now (May) I haven't been to the gym in about two or almost three months because I got pregnant and I couldn't workout on my first trimester. I called several times to try to cancel my gym membership because I have literally been giving away my money. When I do call I am always being told that I have to go in person and speak to a manager and he's only there until 5 Mon-Fri. I get out of work at 6 so I could never cancel my membership and they could care less to help me out!!!
607,1608009,2016-05-24,3,"I joined LA Fitness a year ago... Diagnosed with diabetes I was in a bit of a panic and decided to diet and exercise. A friend of mine was at LA Fit and brought me in. Against her judgement (and she is a lawyer) I signed up not only for membership but for personal training. I sat with a salesperson who was excited and anxious to sign me up... That was ok I knew the score and I could afford the monthly fee. I then asked to speak with someone who could advise me if my scoliosis, sciatica and my weight might be a problem with the scheduled classes... We reviewed the classes and saw I could only benefit from 9am water aerobics and maybe yoga as I was so out of shape and heavy that I would do damage to my cartilage in the more high impact classes. He recommended a personal trainer. BUT when I heard the training was 75 for less than a 1/2 hour I was taken aback. I was a bit desperate and he felt confident that these existing problems would only be helped by the workout. I signed up and yes I did get stronger, BUT I suffered for 3 days after every training session which then slowed down my other exercises. It got to a point where I was out of commission for 3 days each week. My sciatica would kick in after certain exercises and I tried to pin down which ones were responsible. I eventually stopped going due to a carpal tunnel type pain in my wrists... During that time I got a check for overpayment. I had no idea what it was for... I cannot find any online contract and can't find online payments history on personal training. And then a death in the family and various other physical problems... After my contract was expired, I get a call from my trainer and he says I have 30 more sessions. I have no idea what is going on and will continue. By the way I attended 3 days a week of aqua cardio for months which was wonderful BUT the classes got so crowded that I stopped going..."
608,1601916,2016-05-21,1,"I'm there in LA Fitness because unfortunately I have no other option here where I live, but they are swindlers. A year ago I went to the gym and after three months cancel the account because I had to travel. So when I return this year, had to pay $10 for each month. I was out and I was sure I cancel the account. Do not freeze the account. Even I changed the card and went back to ask if everything was closed and canceled. So I had to pay $120 to enter again and that I've mention another scam like they did to my friend."
609,1599933,2016-05-20,1,"I want to share the health journey and experience of a retired couple (my parents) at the La Fitness in Camp Hill PA. The service experience is one that will provide heed to those that may are members or are considering joining. My parents are retired and general members of the La Fitness Camp Hill and are looking to continue to a lifestyle that is of health and well-being. My father became interested in getting personal training for my mother who is a stroke victim. He expressed to the membership consultant that he would be interested in 4 sessions of personal training for my mother. The membership consultant (Tyler) was joined in the sales consultation (Jesse) who tried to influence him as 8 personal sessions. At the end of the day, they ended up selling him a personal training membership for 4 sessions a month for 12 months equating to approximately $2,000. Remind you this is from a retired couple on a fixed income. By all means, this is a buyer beware situation but we are all aware of the manner in which some health facilities operate. Here is where the story becomes interesting. After reviewing the agreement, I contacted the member services department at La Fitness and spoke with Ralph. I explained the situation that the agreement first and foremost was made with the client being my mother while my father signed the agreement and RELEASE OF LIABILITY. I explained to Ralph that while my father only wanted to 4 personal training session he was sold a 12-month agreement. I further explained my concern as to the fact that my mother was a stroke victim. Ralph seemed to understand and advise me to have my parents visit the club with ID to show that the signature on the agreement was not that of the client designated which was my mother but of my father. I was told they could speak with the operations manager (Meghan) and she would be able to assist. I was advised that they would send the agreement to their corporate office to have it canceled. I was hopeful but cautious... Here is why. My parents went to the club with the needed ID asking to speak to Meghan. After being rebuffed, I got the opportunity to speak to Meghan and again explained the situation as to the agreement and that one person could not sign an agreement and release of liability for another. Meghan stated that she would speak with the vice president who happened to be at the club today. I explained to her also as to the condition of my mother being a stroke victim and that a doctor had not cleared her for Personal Training. The agreement has clauses on disability or death mind you. Meghan said that she would speak to the Vice President and personal training manager and get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. I requested speaking to the Vice President to see if I could get his support and confirmation that the agreement could be canceled. I was told I am not permitted to speak to the Vice President because he was in the locker room changing for his workout. Yes! This is what Meghan told me. I told her I looked forward to hearing from her within 48 hours and provided my contact information. Next comes the best part... Not but 10 minutes later, I receive a call from Jesse ** who stated he was from LA Fitness in Camp Hill and the Director of Personal Training. I explained to him I was expecting to hear from Meghan. Jesse went to explain to me in no uncertain terms that he understood the situation and has spoken to Meghan. He stated that he was in charge and would address the issue. I explained again the situation and was looking to have the agreement canceled for the fact the person that signed the agreement was not the person on the agreement; as well as the issue of release of liability for someone else who in this case happens to be a stroke victim. I explained to Jesse that I was concerned as to the qualification of the trainer that she had not been cleared by a physician and he told me that the trainer, Julie, was fully qualified as a master trainer. I asked the qualification of a master trainer and was told to not worry about it. I was advised that she had taken the course at the local community college in personal training. I emphasize my concern again as the liability situation and here is most horrific service statement I have ever heard. Jesse stated that HE DID NOT CARE IF SHE WAS A STROKE VICTIM. I was shocked and speechless. Jesse then proceeds to call me buddy repeatedly in his emphasis that the agreement was the agreement and he was the final say. I thanked him and told him that I look to follow-up. To be continued."
610,1599162,2016-05-20,1,"LOVE this gym but was disrespected so badly yesterday by one of the trainers, ""Juan"". I was in the corner on a mat. He wanted to use the bench (which there were 2 empty ones) picked up my mat & tossed it to the side out of his way. I laughed and got my weights and walked across the room. From the other side of the room he screamed ""IS THERE A PROBLEM"" with his hands out like he wanted to fight me. I didn't even respond just continued my work order. I explained the situation to the manager. He said he would speak to him. As I was walking out of the gym he approached me AGAIN to confront and ask me what my problem was. I refuse to be disrespected and intimidated by an egotistic trainer. He made me so uncomfortable that after this month I will no longer be working out at LA and cancel my contract. He shouldn't be allowed to work with people period. Any man that has that much of a lack of respect for women should work in that type of setting. HE DID ALL OF THIS IN FRONT OF THE POOR MAN HE WAS TRAINING. He's a disgrace to this gym and as a man. Shame because everyone else there are good people."
611,1593381,2016-05-17,1,"As many of the reviews says: DO NOT SIGN UP FOR PERSONAL TRAINING!!!! DO NOT!! They will tell you that you can buy out the agreement and will process it for you immediately. The truth is away far from this! I've been trying to cancel since two months! I went to the personal training manager and he told that he can't do nothing for me so he will call the corporate and return to me! And of course he never did. Until I got charged for monthly ""TRAINING"", I called the corp I explained everything to them. They responded, ""We will take care of it and we will call you in the next two days."" I waited, nothing happens, charged me again. I called in today for the 6th time, someone at the corporate responded and I was so angry and he basically says: ""Oh sorry I can't do nothing for you sir about past!!! If you want to buy the contract out you will have to pay an amount now! Otherwise we can't do nothing!!"" Why he would help me immediately and others can't before? Is it because I have one month left? And the amount for the payout the contract is more than the monthly membership fees? Can't tell.But my advice DO NOT GET INTO PERSONAL TRAINING!! It will turn your life calling LA Fitness hundred times and you will lose money by that time. Which is no way they are going to refund you a penny!! Get a personal training from outside the GYM. Basically my personal trainer was just writing down what exercises should I do!! Everyone having a smartphone now and the app stores are full with the training courses that are exact same thing you will have from personal training program at LA Fitness!! Be smart, save your money. Don't get into the hock!!"
612,1593228,2016-05-17,1,"Every time you make any little small change to your account they charge you 1st and last month fees. It ends up being 100.00 or more. Doesn't seem right. I also ask if I Could add my husband on to my account one person said ""No way."" So I had to get him his own account. 1 year later my friend said that they had lied to me because LAF let her add her husband. I then went to them again to change it and they charge me 100 dollars to transfer him and 1st and last month all over again. A total of almost 200.00, not cool. They really suck."
613,1593117,2016-05-17,1,"My wife became pregnant in November of 2015, so we froze her membership and kept mine active. We both never really made it to the local club to workout. I was reviewing the charges on my credit card when I came across 2 charges 15 days apart from LA Fitness. I called them to find out what might have happened to cause, they claimed that my wife ""who is 7 months pregnant with a high risk pregnancy"" had gone in on a Sunday to work out. I called customer service to explain that there is no possible way that would have taken place, but the customer service representative ""Brittney"" said basically we were lying and that we went to the club to work out. We asked to speak to a manager and she refused claiming that is the manager and she can't do anything to help us. I called back to only get the same runaround. Since I was unable to reach any resolution with them, I have decided to cancel my membership to never return, and I will dispute the charges with my credit card. I have never written a review in my life bad mouthing anyone, but I feel compelled to inform everyone out there about the UNETHICAL practices that LA Fitness is fostering. I will inform everyone I know of this unpleasant experience. Please be careful!!!"
614,1583367,2016-05-12,1,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM!!! I repeat, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM!!! The person who got us into the program was dishonest. We ended up with a program that was way more than we needed. A few months after signing up, I asked the fitness manager if we could downgrade as we were amassing sessions way faster than we were using them. He said he had never heard of them doing that and told me to call corporate. I did. Twice. They never called back. Recently I asked the fitness manager at the club what we could do to stop the bleeding on amassing sessions, as we had amassed 60 unused sessions in 6 months. He told me we could cancel the contract by paying 50% of the remaining balance and that if we purchased one session a month for the remainder of the original contract that we could use the 60 sessions whenever we wanted. He said he just needed to get sign-off from corporate, but that was just a formality and wasn't an issue. I noted on the cancellation contract that unused sessions would expire 30 days after the last billing. He reassured me that this wasn't an issue and that the new contract would define that the unused sessions would carry on indefinitely. Today I came in to sign the new contract, and he told me that they couldn't extend the sessions and that they would cancel in 3 weeks. Needless to say I gave them an earful. The excuse they gave for not being able to do it was ludicrous and didn't make any sense. These people are deceptive liars. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!!!"
615,1577285,2016-05-10,1,"The LA Fitness ""Signature"" club in Secaucus, NJ is a dirty place. The locker room area is disgusting with dirty towels left on the floor and counters, the showers need scrubbing and disinfecting, the whirlpool is always a hazard with what looks like fecal matter on the foam. The shower curtains are ripped. The Sauna has roaches crawling in it and the staff is disrespectful and unprofessional. They hoard towels and get very nasty if you request more than two. I complained and was told by Gonzalo (Manager) to bring my own towels or CANCEL membership if I don't like the policy. Can you imagine that? I'm paying for towel service but must bring my own towels? WTH is that about? I have never seen a business who discards customers who express a complaint. All of the staff at the Secaucus club should be fired. They charge more than other clubs because of the towels yet they deny people the use of same. Regional Manager (Greg) got two messages from me but has not responded to date. Very poor management skills. I further relate that they allow lowlife people to join who go into the whirlpool with their sweaty clothes from machine workouts and some men wear their underwear to swim. DISGUSTING!!! This club should be closed down."

618,1554674,2016-04-28,1,"I am a member of the LA Fitness in Florida on 184th West Pines Fla. On 4-28-2016 I arrived at the gym to take a Cycling class at 5-30 (Instructor **). Got to the class late, so I set up my bike, said hi to my friend whom was struggling to do workout. I started laughing. My friend left early, of course but I finished. After class instructor came up to me while I was still trying to get some extra min. in seeing I was late. I thought he was going to say the class was over so I should just finish up. But to my surprise, he verbally attacked me. He said to me, “You came to my class late and you & your Fat friend was giggling & you were late.” I said ""I am not a child, do not come up in my face.” He went crazy. This man looked like some caged ANIMAL. All of a sudden this man turned into a animal. He said, “Next time you come to my ** class have some ** respect,” on top of his voice. I turned to him and said, “You have no ** respect, who the hell you talking to?” At that time 3 people came in. I continued to react to him. I was not only surprise but ANGRY. I said, “I am going to report you have no respect.” He said, “I don't ** care with people there.” I stormed out the class and proceeded to go to the Manager, went to the front desk. By this time I was fuming. I told the Manager, “The ** instructor cursed at me. I was going off.” I said, “No matter what happen he should not have cursed at me. I am not a child.” I asked for corporate and call them still fuming. He said he would speak to him. Shortly after the instructor came quite as a LAMB.I was still angry. I cussed at him again. The Manager took him one side & he proceed to tell him he never cursed. He was not only disrespectful but a coward & liar too right in my face. I called Head Office, made a complaint & cancelled my membership. I spoke to the Manager after he was done speaking to the Instructor (**) & he had the nerve to tell me I need a witness. It is his word against mine. REALLY I was not only violated and abused at the hands of a Instructor who lied but the Manager had the nerve to insult my integrity after the injustice I just received at the hands of their employee.It is very sad that in this time and age people are allowed to be abused, treated like GARBAGE and they are paying customers. This ANIMAL (**) a grown 55-year old man gets away with not only violating me but lie in my face and it is my word against his (Shame on them). Something is wrong with this picture. I have no reason to lie or attack anyone. I am not crazy. If you disrespect me in any way I will stand up for myself even if I STAND ALONE…But I promise you this will happen again he will lose his cool. I promise you people like this man display a violent behavior. It is something he does all the time but the next time he will hit someone then LA Fitness will have to deal with this. He does not know what he is doing. No one can understand him so I guess that is where his frustration comes into play. If you have low self esteem your character will somehow display itself in various forms. This man is a BULLY and I have no doubt he beats on women or people he thinks he can push around. Very good at masking his violent display of behavior.I will never forget this and will make sure people know about this kind of behavior which is not acceptable by no means and let them know who he is (**). No matter what someone has done no one has the right to degrade them or disrespect them. Things have a way of coming back around full circle. One good thing came out of this. The young lady I spoke to at Corporate office was very understanding. Thank you."

620,1540454,2016-04-20,1,"I originally signed up for an all sport (club) membership for 34.** a month on a no-initiation fee promotion. I'm on social security retirement pension and needed to lower my expenses, so I changed my membership to just 1 club and signed a paper which confirmed the change. Well, 30 days later, they debited my bank account for the original 34 dollars plus 3 dollars and created an overdraft. I called them and spoke to someone in corporate who kept me on hold for quite some time. She tells me that the person who handled this change did it incorrectly and I will have to pay a 49.00 initiation fee to change my membership to just a single club instead of the all clubs membership I originally had. This is a rip-off and I'm cancelling the membership and closing my bank account, and informing my family and friends to do the same. All of this foolishness behind a difference of 4.00 a month."
621,1536977,2016-04-19,1,"To put it bluntly, THE GLENDALE HTS LA FITNESS IS BY FAR THE WORST RUN GYM I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO FREQUENT IN MY entire life. The fact that this gym is only a couple years old only makes it worse, that it can become such a cesspool of crap in that short of a period is mind boggling. I have been going to the GDH Bally's and now LA as my ""home gym"" since I moved to GDH in 1992 (almost 25 years). I recall fondly the clientele of that gym throughout the 90's when that location was the ""place to be,"" when Heather Locklear actually appeared there for the opening and it was hailed as the Bally's prototype. Now I'm not sure if it's mostly due to the changing demographics in the area since 2000 but the ignorance of the gym users to return equipment (especially dumbbells) to their proper location is out of control. I cannot even get through my Thursday dumbbell workout without having to go on a ""gym expedition"" to locate weights. This is mostly with 20's, 22.5, 25, 27.5's but yesterday a 60 was MIA. In addition, your people have OVERSOLD this gym. It is DANGEROUS by the dumbbells and squat racks, where members are forced to workout in aisles and spaces between racks and benches because there is NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I was injured last month when someone who was doing biceps curls between benches slammed their weight into my forearm as I stood from my bench to return my weights to the rack. My forearm was black and blue for almost a week.Also, that basketball court is nothing more than a breeding ground for gang-banger wannabes. I have seen several dangerous situations, where blows have been thrown during a heated game. In addition, these punks exit the court to get a drink, shirtless, spouting F-bombs, right in front of Personal Trainers near the staircase. Why don't YOUR EMPLOYEES say something? Are they afraid? Are they not instructed to keep control in the gym? Have also personally found a switchblade knife that apparently fell out of a member's pocket while he was benching (I brought it to the front desk) and have observed other members with knives and box cutters in holders on their belt while working out. Riddle me this, why do you need a knife or box cutter at the gym?When it was Bally's the Manager got on the PA system and asked members to PLEASE RETURN WEIGHTS to their proper racks at least ONCE AN HOUR. I have NEVER heard one of these LA Fitness dolts make even ONE announcement. This is ONLY at Glendale Heights IL. I have recently been to the LA in Hanover Park, IL Oak Brook, IL, Naperville, IL and Oswego, IL and 2 in Clearwater, FL, where weights are all put away. Members there would be EMBARRASSED to leave a dumbbell unracked.So is it just the clientele? Or is it the lackadaisical attitude of this locations' staff? Do they have NO PRIDE in their gym? I NEVER see a Personal Trainer pick up a weight and return it to a rack, especially dumbbells. When this was a Bally's Personal Trainers would have been EMBARRASSED at the condition of the gym, they would take it upon themselves to go and rack some weights. Or is the ONLY objective of this staff to sell memberships? This gym is DANGEROUSLY oversold and overcrowded. I can only assume this is the case because I NEVER see an employee get OFF THEIR ASS and do ANYTHING to organize this gym. I used to love the gym, it was a sanctuary to relieve stress. Now when I get to the gym I GET STRESSED, just looking at an empty rack of dumbbells, from 15-27.5, NOTHING! All spewn about. Do LA Fitness Managers take pride in your gyms? Or is it all about $$$."

623,1521038,2016-04-12,1,"I opened an account with these LA Fitness Located in Southland Mall, Address: 20505 S Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33189 with ** 5 month ago. I told him that I was in the city but going to move anytime. He explained that I could open the account and freeze it while I was out of town. I asked him if there was any charge for this and he said ""NO"". After one month I was charge for the day care that I had included in my membership. I called him and he promise that it will be taken care of. We are now in April and they still continue to charge my card $10.97 a month. I called again and now he tells me that these charges are from having the account frozen, (something he told me there was no charge). I then asked him to cancel my membership and he promised that it will be canceled the next day. At 7:00 PM EST the membership was still active. I then called customer service and they agreed to cancel it. This gym is full of liars. They will tell you anything to get you sign up for a membership. Don't trust them. They will steal your money. Even when ** from customer service recognized that he had lied, they did not refund the money they unjustly charge me. Beware of these thieves. I wish I could give them a zero star rating."
624,1508993,2016-04-06,1,"I was told I had to call and cancel. When I called I was told I need to come in to cancel, and when I went in to cancel I was told I was cancelled and NOW they say: ""Oh, no sir. You need to talk to the operations manager to cancel"". This is a huge scam designed to scam three months more out of your pocket. I am seriously considering filing a suit at this point. It's not the 20 some dollars a month, it's the shady business practice."
625,1506668,2016-04-05,2,"Although no one wants to be The Bad Guy. Leaving weights on bars and dumb bells on the floor forces me to hunt down the person and ask... ""Are you done with that?"" Sometimes I've seen people put a personal item on a bench in an effort to reserve it while they go change! Very often it's a workout bag even though they aren't supposed to be in the gym floor. One location in McDonough Ga: two guys brought their own MP3 player. Turned it up all the way while they did their squats! All this wouldn't be so bad if someone policed at least a little. Often it seems to be the trainers who leave the weights! I have seen countless arguments. Why establish rules that are just ignored by the workers?"
626,1506242,2016-04-05,1,"I joined when the club was fairly new. I paid an initiation fee and pay more per month now than anyone I talk to. When addressing this with management, they of course can do nothing to adjust the price. Of course I can PAY to have the price adjusted. Of the 3 people at the club I was talking to, only one of them was even nice. The other two talked to me as if I was insignificant & they could care less. They said ""only corporate could do any price adjusting"", so I asked for corporates phone number. JACOB made a point to put a note under my account so corporate was ready for my call. So not only did the man at corporate talk to me like I was a moron, like most of the men working there do, but he was rude and condescending as well. I don't mind paying for something if I'm getting my money's worth. But over the last year or so, the place has deteriorated. The shower heads are covered with green lime scale (I have the same water & I clean mine & they don't look like that), the spa (when it works) has a greasy film on the tiles and on top the water, and every time I'm there, there's at least a few cardio machines out of order.Worst of all, I don't work out near closing time anymore. I don't feel safe. When I told the condescending man from corporate, he said they provide lighting in the parking lot, the rest is my responsibility, and if something were to happen, it's not their fault. In addition to not feeling safe, I've told staff who were working at the time, that there is a member whose family doesn't watch her properly, and she's walked in on me showering. This is not the club I signed up with seven years ago, and I no longer feel I'm getting what I pay for. I WAS ALSO TOLD MONTHLY PRICES WILL RISE TO $39.99/month."
627,1497284,2016-03-31,2,"The salesperson danced around with numbers and prices. I signed up for 1 yr of the regular $40.00 training sessions. He told me he would give me 8 free. I chose to use 2 of them to front load my 1st 2 weeks. For 2 weeks my trainer (who is amazing) patiently tried to add my number to the training schedule so he can get paid for my sessions. The number would not work and the trainer asked me to go talk to the salesperson. Then I'm told I have 2 different account numbers 1 for membership and one for training. We get the number and it still doesn't work. The trainer asked me to get back with salesperson and he said, ""I'm really sorry. Your trainer (that he assigned me to, who I love) is a MASTER TRAINER requiring an additional amount of money per month ($28)."" His comment was he hired my trainer as a regular trainer, but then the next day they upgraded him to a master trainer. His solution was, ""We can upgrade you with NO upgrade charge or we will have to change your trainer to a lower level trainer."" His solution was to have me upgrade to master trainer and give me the additional equivalent in additional Free sessions which was 9 more free.I said, ""I have to upgrade to keep my trainer?"" He said, ""Yes,"" or lose my trainer. I felt pressured, he kept apologizing for his mistake. My trainer said he was hired as a master trainer and this has happened to him with other clients and what I was told was an accident I now realize was nonethical practices. It was brought to my attention that this is common practice for LA Fitness because the sales guy gets more commission. I know I took the extra to compensate for the dollar amount that I'm being charge. Also, the other six he is saying they were locked originally but now is saying that those are being used for my 1st month since I'm not charged until following month. I feel the runaround has made this gym experience very unpleasant. The gym is close to my house, and I really like my trainer, but a lot of the electronic equipment has issues that are not being addressed."
628,1494614,2016-03-30,1,"I don't know where to start about this gym. It's filthy dirty. A mess with weights everywhere. The management is not professional and rude. I have heard cases from friends of fraud (forging signatures) on contracts, lying that other gyms were closing down so as to gain clients! They over pressure and undeliver on selling memberships. Most of personal trainers are completely oblivious to giving clients the best training. Don't give in to this gym hype... It's not!!!"
629,1484171,2016-03-24,1,"I am pleading to the person reading this to please start an investigation against the policies and practices of LA Fitness. They really need to be stopped. There are several people interested in a class action lawsuit because of continual unethical business practices including, fraud, scams, altering membership documents, harassment, unauthorized charges, and manipulation of clients in a vulnerable state. If you do research you will see the continual negative comments made by thousands of disgruntles clients stating similar problems. Please be aware that information sent by LA Fitness has in many instances been altered or forged, including but not limited to membership cancellations. By far the most horrid organization I have encountered. LA Fitness is comprised of scam artists, liars and frauds who operate on a level lower than can be imagined; those who are vulnerable. A recent membership has turned into an absolute nightmare and the worst part is the unprofessional flippant behaviors on the corporate level. I stopped going to LA Fitness over a year ago, filled out my membership cancellation, a manager provided help for this, and they have continued to charge my credit card and harass me. I am in constant dispute and now they claim the gym where I signed up had no knowledge of anything that occurred with the manager, because she is no longer there, and therefore refuse to acknowledge my membership cancellation. It is clear my membership was cancelled over a year ago, and it is clear because they don't even have a proper date registered as to when I went to the gym because the dates are so far back, over a year. They cannot give me the last date of attendance. This is the date I cancelled my membership and my training sessions. My father was ill. The manager explained she would be cancelling both the sessions and membership. LA Fitness is claiming I still had a membership even though I cancelled training sessions. However as I mentioned, there is absolutely NO PROOF they are willing to give regarding the last date I entered their club because IT IS TOO long ago according to their records. This is the information I was given by Casey ** a managing rep from corporate.They also refused to acknowledge the manager ever took part in this because the manager is new and someone I never had contact with. The previous manager no longer works for the gym, so I was told. However this is also not true, she no longer works for that particular gym in Chula Vista but she still does work for LA Fitness. The trainer is still employed at the location, but he also refused to give information to corporate. I have emails, text messages and phone records completely negating what LA Fitness has told me. They have continued to charge my credit card without authorization and I am not in dispute with my bank as a result of these charges."
630,1479479,2016-03-22,1,"My wife Deborah went to LA Fitness in the second week of November 2015 to sign up with the gym and also to get some personal training. She wanted 8 sessions of personal training, one per week. The person she talked to offered her different options of 8 sessions or 12 sessions. She was never offered 6 months or 12 months of personal training. She and I agreed on before she went to LA Fitness that she will get about 10 personal training sessions. In order to sign up for personal training sessions LA Fitness requires to be a gym member because only gym members can use the gym. Gym membership is $29.95. Deborah wanted a 12 months gym membership. She gave them the credit card to process the membership and then signed on a tablet the ""contract"" for the personal training.However, the agreed upon details of the contract were not visible or readable on the tablet. Nothing indicated that the ""contract"" was over anything different than 8 sessions of personal training. That is what was written down by hand on a piece of paper. 8 sessions of personal training was her intention and the person processing that never indicated otherwise. So the real contract was over 8 sessions, each sessions $55 with one session per week, billed monthly at $220.The print out of the fraudulent ""contract"" was however over 51 plus 3 sessions and 12 times $220! When we saw that LA Fitness was taking money out from our credit card beyond the 8 sessions, we disputed with AMEX. We did cancel whatever legal part of contract or gym membership is valid. We do NOT acknowledge the faked contract that LA Fitness fabricated. That one never got valid as Deborah never had the intention to do more than 8 sessions."
631,1474043,2016-03-19,1,"I have been with La fitness for a month and I have realized they were lying to me from the very first. I want to sue their guts out for not telling a single truth. For one thing I should have seen this website. One thing for sure they locked my internet which is unusual for a company to do that and the employees there talk like businessmen pushing products that does not exist. I want everyone like me to sue La fitness and take the company down. Here's the scene, I walked in with my sons and have sat down with a very fat man. We talked and talked and me new to persuading businessmen bought a membership to La fitness... They have lied. I bought their service because of the deal on internet!!! It was dated THE SAME EXACT DAY!!! THE DEAL STATED $17 and THAT GUY SAID the special deal has ended!!! My kids have wanted to try out and me with my kids not knowing anything got convinced in. ALSO ACCOUNT FREEZE WAS DETAILED TO BEING ""FREE"". For my son and IT WAS ** $10 fee WHICH IS A LIE.Another thing I HATE BEING OFFERED 44 dollars instead of initial entrance fee - OFFERED A MONEY BACK IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GYM... Any body who are affected by la fitness listen up pass out boycotts and file lawsuits so we take them on terms papers were not given to me a (mere sign is nothing)!!! I THINK I HAVE A GOOD REASON TO SUE THAT **."
632,1471773,2016-03-18,1,"My family and I are been members of the La Fitness in Naples Florida (Vanderbilt Beach Road and Tamiami Trail). We chose this gym specifically for the sauna, hot tub and pool amenities. In the last year we have expressed our concerns and complaints directly to the staff and to the corporate office. We have repeatedly informed them that the sauna and hot tub did not work properly or did not work at all, and that the pool temperature is always cold. Despite our complaints it is an ongoing problem. Just today my husband went to the gym, worked out and went to use the hot tub. Upon entering the hot tub the water was cold. He communicated with the front desk staff and asked why the hot tub wasn't working. The staff member informed my husband that he wasn't aware it wasn't working. Really?? Are we to believe that for safety of the members the water temperature and integrity of these amenities are not being checked, and monitored throughout the day. If so is this not a safety hazard? Despite the ongoing problems and all the bad reviews, LA FITNESS continues to charge its members the regular member dues. I am demanding that La Fitness make it right, correct the problems, provide their customers with the amenities and customer service as promised. Or alternative refund all members that have filed complaints for services not rendered as per the membership contract agreement. Their choice!! Something must be done."
633,1452804,2016-03-10,1,"I want to start off by saying I have been a member with LA Fitness for about 8 years. I was in the gym the other day, and was just doing my workout routine in the free weight section. I had been waiting on the crossover cables machine and was working on a machine right next to it so I could get on it when the person was finished. As I started to do the crossover cables I was then approached by a very aggressive guy that rudely said he still had more sets to do, basically get off of the machine. I replied, ""I'm finishing my sets and then you can have it, it would have taken about 5 minutes."" I was so taken back by his demeanor and tone on his approached to me it was really shocking. To be honest, if he had said ""can I work my sets in with you"" I would have had no problem doing that. Anyways, that is not the way it went down. He proceeded to tell me off to my face saying I was a **, he then berated me very loudly around the gym calling me a ** over and over and over again which lasted for about 10 minutes. I have never had someone talk to me in this vulgar manner EVER! The entire gym heard this guy berate me. I'm 5'3"" and he was much bigger than me. His intimidating behavior made me feel threatened and humiliated. I then proceeded to management to express my concerns. I explained what had happened and the operational manager went and talked to the guy that was cursing me and demeaning my character. After he came back to me I was told by the LA Fitness operational manager I didn't handle the situation right, and he said it was a ""He said She said situation"". The guy lied to the manager saying I had cursed at him and moved his stuff, which wasn't true. I didn't see his stuff, so how could I have moved it.Even if I had thrown his stuff out of the way, was his abusive display justified? I think not. There was someone that just left the machine and there was no known indication he or anybody else was waiting to use this machine or I would have yielded. I really try be gracious and understanding. I contemplated calling 911 as this situation was going on and did not want to call my husband because he would have talked with the guy directly and would not have appreciated his attitude. I did not want to make the scene bigger. My Husband talked to the police about the situation and the police said I should have called 911 immediately. The policeman said they have had problems with people breaking into cars and the lockers. Next time I will call 911 immediately. Just so you know, there are no cameras at LA Fitness. I have terminated my membership and will never go back because of the way the local and corporate management handled the situation."
634,1449483,2016-03-09,1,"I had my membership with LA Fitness for 10yrs! I have been coming to this Johns Creek location for 1 1/2 yrs now. They hired all new staffs, new managers. New operations (customer service) manager ""La Tasha""? ""Le Tasha""? Try to avoid her. She is at the front desk will NOT greet you or greet back! Or will not help you without using her power!!! I ask for one day guest pass she make us wait for 26mins. She was very, very rude!!! She ask me about my (""10yrs"") membership few times - how long, where did you sign up, how often do you bring guess, did you pay the membership this month, why did I see you here... After all of the inappropriate questions, she act like she is doing me a favor to issue a day guest pass. She told me this is one time deal... I'm still shocked when others in the gym told me that she was the new manager. She speak to everyone in a patronizing manner. My other friends start telling me how she insulted a lot of people in the gym with her power. There is other issues in this gym but this new manager La Tasha... I want to ask whoever hire this mean and rude La Tasha, did he or she think about gym is industry where you have to deal with customer service issues. Manager might have to consider smile, do like people, might need interpersonal skills, listen, problem analysis and solving... I see her in the very front! She look so mean and rude!!! I feel very STRESS!!! I guess I'll cancel my 10yrs membership for someone only been there month."
635,1442673,2016-03-06,1,Signed a contract for personal training at LA fitness for a year. Two months prior to the contract expiring I asked management if I needed to do anything because I was not going to renew the contract. I was told no. That it was a one year contract and would automatically expire. Unfortunately the month after my contract expired LA fitness charged my bank account for another month. Calling to inquire I was told that I needed to put my request for canceling in writing contrary to what I was previously told. I called their corporate office to complain and was promised they would investigate. It has been three months now and have not heard back. Very disappointed that a company such as LA fitness would be so deceitful to a loyal customer.
636,1428222,2016-02-28,4,"I have been a member of LA fitness 14 years or more. I visit the gym(s) about 5 to 6 times a week. I said gym(s) because I visit many over the Atlanta area. I recommend the gyms to my friends because I think that if used properly they can give great overall health benefits. I have noticed a lot of complaints are about the trainers. I do not use the professional trainer programs so I do not have any comment on that part of the gyms. I find in most places the staff seems to be courteous and always willing to listen. However especially in the newer gyms I find people that do not know what they are talking about so instead of saying ""I don't know"" they lie. In one of the gyms that is just a little over a year old they have a problem with the dry sauna in the men's locker room always being broken. When I asked the response is always ""It is not our fault a member keeps putting water on the heater causing it to burn out"" and ""When a piece of equipment goes bad we have to wait for the corporate office to send us a new one.""I understand that they cannot control what members do however this happens at a lot of their gyms. You would think by now they would know how to handle this problem. When I spoke to the OM she said there is nothing they can do. I suggested that because I have seen this happen many times a quick and rather easy fix is to tell all the staff that cover the front door when a member comes in just say ""We are looking for the person that is pouring water on the heaters in the saunas. We need to explain that he is causing the heaters to short and no longer work. So if you see a person do that please notify a staff member as soon as possible.""Her response was that it probably won't work. Not many members will be that active. I said ""I know however if you say this to every member for a week you probably will put the person on notice that you are looking for him and he will stop."" ""We have already posted signs on the door."" My question to you the corporate office. If it is true that all equipment must be approved from you first why don't you have a simple training class on new gyms to stop this large expense and waste of the customers time."
637,1425928,2016-02-27,1,"I have been member of LA Fitness for last couple of months and I was paying for 250$ every month for personal training. I have to move to another location because of my job and there is no LA fitness over there. So I requested them to cancel my contract as per the agreement. They asked me to provide either a driver licence very recent or utility bill or USPS Change of Address Confirmation or Rental Agreement. As I don't have utility bill on my name I told I can submit change of address. So they provided me a letter asking me to send it to California by Mail. That too the original copy. In the meantime one of my billing cycle passed and I have to pay for that month without using the service. After I received the Change of address I mailed them as they suggested. But I didn't receive any confirmation on it. So I asked them after 10 days what is the issue, Now they say they didn't receive it. And they are going to charge for next month. The justification provided by Daniella (says that she is the supervisor over there) that they have 800 locations nationwide and it takes time to process. And they are going to charge me for this month as well. Then they asked me to submit other proof then I told I can submit the rental agreement. Then this guy says ""as per the rules we won't accept it."" I mentioned ""when I called you last time you only asked for a rental agreement."" Then he says that ""the information provided by him is incorrect."" ""What is this are you guys out of your minds?"" LA fitness Management has to seriously rethink before hiring these kind of nuts.All the time during the call they have been very rude to me especially DANIELLA and the other Guy who spoke to me. The other guy when asked to escalate the issue to next level, he claims that ""she is not available"" first and then ""there is no one on top of him"" and at last this so called DANIELLA came into picture.They were so pleading at the time of joining and once we sign the contract they are torturing people like this. As we giving the business and you are not capable of handling 800 locations then you should not trouble your customers in this way. When I asked for the reference of the call they claim that they can't provide any and as I insisted she provided her employee id: That is ** Name: Daniella. I hope at least this will be addressed by the Club. If not guys that is up to you to choose this club or not."
638,1420852,2016-02-24,1,"February 2015 I decided to sign up for a gym in south FL and walked into LA fitness in Sunrise FL. Little did I know that by doing this I would be getting robbed. I decided to sign up for a 3 year contract because I had just had knee surgery and gained some weight and promised myself I would get back into the best shape of my life. Gyms are supposed to help people and motivate them not trick them and steal from them. At the time I had no intentions on leaving the state and I was assured by the staff, Clark, who was the manager at the time, that if I ever needed to cancel I would get a refund. I signed the contract trusting that the information I was given was accurate. The contract was emailed to me after a few days. This month, February 2016, I have relocated to Durham NC for a job opportunity and called to cancel my membership and get a refund. Well, it seems that I don't qualify for a refund because of the laws in FL. Somehow corporate knows about these laws but the gym staff does not. I called the Sunrise location and I spoke with the manager that is currently there and he told me to go ahead and call the corporate office and that they will most certainly give me a refund. Apparently corporations like LA fitness can steal your money and walk away with it. This experience has made me disgusted with this gym and I would say that this is the first and last time I let someone take advantage of me or anyone else, which is why I am writing this. I have a lot of friends in the fitness industry that advised me against signing up with LA fitness but I didn't listen and this is where it got me. If you are reading this do yourself a favor and find another gym. ** LA FITNESS!!!"
639,1420570,2016-02-24,1,"I had been a member of Bally Total Fitness for years and when they were bought out by LA Fitness is when I became a member. I guess Bally made some sort of deal with LA Fitness and my membership is $119.00 per year. Well, I pay that annual fee even though I haven't been to LA Fitness as religiously as I was going to Bally and this is because their group fitness class schedules are simply awful. Well today, I thought I'd upgrade my membership to Signature status so that I could go to the location that is closer to my job (Chicago Streeterville). I called and spoke to Casey. She asked for my existing membership information and I gave it to her and then she said that an upgrade for me would be $420.00 per year. Even, though that is in addition to the $119.00 that I've already paid, I thought I'll go ahead because I guess it's my cost of convenience. Then, just when I was about to agree to upgrade, Casey says, ""Oh wait, actually it will cost you $538 plus a $99 initiation fee and this totals $637 which all needs to be paid upfront. No monthly payments."" I said, ""No monthly payments?"" she said, ""Yes, no monthly payments and this is because you pay your membership annually and this upgrade has to be paid in full. Next year, you can begin to pay monthly.""I was flabbergasted! I'm an existing customer who pays the membership fee religiously and I'm asking to upgrade and I have to pay upfront. This is a clear indication that LA Fitness isn't concerned with customer retention. After I told her ""No thank you."" She just said, ""You can give me a call if you decide to change your mind."" I was speechless! After reading all the negative reviews about the professionalism of LA Fitness staff, I'm kind of glad that Casey deterred me from spending additional money with LA Fitness."
640,1414540,2016-02-23,1,So I went to try the gym and see how I like it because coworker told me about classes. So I give it a try. The guy say that he need it to show me the gym and I need it to check in with him. I say I just wanted to try it. I did. I like the class. Next day I come back and it was another person I have to do it again. I did. Well I went back and for the 3 time and they say I couldn't go in. That my trial was done that I have to be there 3 days in a row. I work. I have a busy life just when I was thinking on getting to become a member. But after that no way - I say I'll take my business somewhere else.
641,1414330,2016-02-23,1,"A complete ripoff, you are charged even if you can't use your session. I went away on business many times and came back to see old trainers gone and new ones in their place. Sometimes there would be no trainers available at all for weeks. They sell these training sessions without even having dedicated trainers. They don't review your information, they don't even read the book they fill out for you. I couldn't be more unhappy with my experience. I feel like I have just thrown my money away. They expect your money every month but they don't care if they can deliver a trainer or not. They just keep charging you and adding sessions to your queue. Terrible business ethics."
642,1407829,2016-02-19,1,"I am unemployed and need to eliminate certain expenses at this time. I was told by multiple employees (at multiple locations) to just stop paying my LA Fitness monthly bill. I was also told that they don't report the delinquencies to collections. I have fantastic credit and honor my debts. I wrote to headquarters about my current situation and was told I need to 'buy' out the remainder of my contract. They refuse to take my current situation into consideration. I will never, never, never do business with this corporation again. I will never suggest to anyone, even my worst enemy, to do business with them. They are in it only for the money and lack the needed customer service skills necessary to meet their customers' changing needs, especially in times of crisis. I took care of this honestly even when I was told BY THEIR EMPLOYEES to just refuse to pay my bill. What legitimate and honest organization's staff suggests such a thing? Stay away! Far, far away!"
643,1403287,2016-02-17,1,"So, I purchased a membership on a day where it was less than the standard membership fee for their open house day. Signed on the membership, signed the contract (online and no paper contract was seen), signed up for a trainer's program. On the day I signed up, I was informed they would install heavy punching bags for boxing and I was looking for a gym that had equipment for boxing. Months later, I was informed that heavy bags were not going to be placed in the new locations, but old locations would still have them. After confirming that, I cancelled my membership and the fee associated with it. Two months after, I noticed my account was being deducted $135 each month. I found out the $135 each month was a Trainer's Fee, which was a separate charge. Then to cancel the Trainer's Fee was to buy out of the contract, was $472.50!? I couldn't even get my money back from the months I clearly never visited the gym. Moral of the story. Be really good at reading a contract. Only sign up when you know something is there. And Personal Training is best left alone. The only redeeming quality of LA Fitness is the class teachers are honest, but the personal trainers are just plain salespeople."

Firstly, I'd like to say when I signed up I was 20 years old and was scammed out of $170 for a personal trainer in addition to $170 that I paid for my membership installment fee. I DID NOT -- I repeat -- DID NOT/ HAVE NOT received NOT ONE personal training session. When I tried to (years ago) claim my session I was told I owed another $75 in order to get a session in. After that -- I said screw the sessions & never went back for another & LA kept my $170 that I'd initially put down. Here it is 2016... In terms of the gym now -- Like so many others I've made multiple complaints to management. I've called in to 800- customer service numbers, I've spoken with the gym managers of local locations -- ALL TO NO AVAIL. This gym is a total User/Scamming system [very much like the people in this city sad to say]. I signed up for a 'health club' not a ymca -- the gym now rents out pool area to children... soon to rent out part of gym to physical therapy place -- machines are down 2+ weeks if broken. Roof leaks in locker room/workout area. Sauna benches are old and creaking. Many members are afraid to sit on them in fear of falling thru so we just stand most of the time. Nothing is usually done, not on ANY end of the company in terms of fixing these issues. AS LONG AS THEY'RE sucking that $30-$40 bucks monthly like Clockwork out of your bank account honey -- LA could give a damn. I'm soon to cancel membership...too many options these days."
645,1387603,2016-02-10,1,"I have been LIED to! I was told I could get a multi state pass for $25, and $54.90 a month in membership dues. We also wanted a family plan where our children could visit the childcare while we exercised. The first day, my wife whom is in another state goes to use it and gets denied. Several phone calls and visits to the location and no results until the sales manager shows back up and says ""Oh. Oops… We have to charge $75 more for the multi state."" We pay the $75 and are promised guest passes to use that we never received until the change takes place. We finally after 2 months go to the gym once and have my son added, which my wife planned on doing when she went and was denied. OH NO. ""The price for that changed seven days later even though we never let you use the account because we lied and sold you the wrong membership!"" NOW I HAVE TO SWIPE MY card again!!! And pay more per month on top of the two months I lost! WTF! LA Fitness has lied to me, conned and cheated me out of my hard earned money. BUYERS BEWARE!"
646,1384642,2016-02-09,1,"The worst contract to sign and please let me tell you that they fail to mention half of the fines for cancelling. I was a member for a year, they were having a special on the personal trainer I started but could no longer continue due to work schedule. I went in person and was told had to wait for a manager to show up. Two hours later and no manager. They could not get a hold of him. Gave me a number to cancel and I called they still DID not cancel my account 2 months later!!! I would not recommend this to my enemy..."
647,1375467,2016-02-04,1,"Since I started at La Fitness I have had an appointment with a trainer blown off with no explanation to this date 2/4/2015. I join in early December. For two weeks there was no hot water in the women's and men's showers. I once asked a desk clerk if there was a phone number to be called to find out if the hot tub was open to which she reply it is available now for my use, instead of answering my question, I found out later it wasn't available for days. My wife bought my membership so I have to stick it out, otherwise I would go back to Planet fitness Orange."
648,1375323,2016-02-04,1,"I purchased training sessions for a 1 year term which was fine. Only that with my work schedule it was hard to get into the gym but much harder to get a good personal training session with the personal trainer. I eventually had to freeze my account after not being able to go in for a few months, I believe they charge 10 buck to freeze it not the full fee but when I unfroze my account I continued going to the gym to work out and finally I decided I really needed to get in shape and I had to use up my sessions. I had 53 sessions still dreaming to be used from the ones I had in my contract. Usually if you purchase sessions and the year is up obviously you want to be able to keep using them right?? They are your sessions that you purchased! Well that is not the case with LA Fitness, let me tell you they suggested I reactivate my account to use the sessions I have not used! Meaning, pay again! The hell with them. $3000 dollars later and I never got any training plus the trainers I did use suckkk!! The first guy that did train me left to a better gym. Really wish I could find him now! Good luck and make sure you read everything through!"
649,1373940,2016-02-04,1,"I moved to Atlanta about two years ago and people in general have been very nice. It's certainly got that southern charm. I didn't understand why some people say there are a lot of ""rednecks"" here and I thought they were just being biased. However, I think today I might have experienced my first one. I scheduled a tour with the sales representative William ** tonight at LA fitness Windward Pkwy, Alpharetta location and everything went smoothly in the beginning. I didn't attempt to negotiate on anything at all and quickly chose their single club membership plan. I was told I could make reservation for racquetball court and I could use my membership for the racquetball service. I was asked to sign on their electric pad before I could read any papers. But in the end, after I was charged, I saw some $5 extra charge per month on the ""official"" paper. When I asked about that charge, another employee, Mark **, jumped in. He said they can't take that $5 off until tomorrow when the operations manager arrived. It turned out this fee was an additional ""reservation privilege fee"" and without paying it I wouldn't be able to schedule even 30 minutes in advance to reserve a court. That really didn't make sense to me. But what I cared about the most was that they should fully informed before adding charges to my membership. The Mark guy apparently has a short temper. He said ""you could cancel your membership if you have problem with it."" Then I'm like, ""If that's the case, I'd like to cancel it"". Then he started saying ""It's unreasonable"" while he was doing the cancellation on the computer. He said ""People find all the excuses to quit exercising and you found yourself a good one"". He definitely has some attitude issue as a sales person. What upset me the most was he started calling me, ""ridiculous"". I asked him ""So far, have I said anything impolite and rude to you? I understand if you say I'm unreasonable because we have different standpoints, but you keep saying I'm 'ridiculous'."" He replied ""I do think you are ridiculous"" and he complained about spending time with me for nothing.In my heart, I think he's the one who's ridiculous here to say things like that to their potential customers. But I still kept it to myself. I said ""I've come all the way here and actually already paid to join the club, I spent the same amount of time as you guys. I did want to join. But as a customer, don't I have rights to have all the knowledge that I'm supposed to know? I want to join a club I feel happy with. Now you made me feel uncomfortable. Again, have I said anything rude to you?"" Then he's like, ""OK, I apologize."" He said that in his arrogant tone. But I didn't want to argue with someone like him anymore. I asked him his name and if the store manager will be here sometime. He's like ""I'm the general manager here."" (Hmmm, interesting, if you are the general manager here, why did I have to wait for someone else to reverse the charge?) Now it's all understandable to me. He must think he's the ""big guy"" here. Everyone should follow his rules. But I'm sorry, Mark. Not everyone has to follow your rule. Luckily, in a free market economy, I've got choices and I've chosen another path since you may don't care about my business. But with that attitude, I wonder if you would lose more customers or even your friends. Or maybe you don't care. Anyways, that was my short experience with the LA fitness at Windward Pkwy. I hope this story gives you a rough idea how they conduct business there. Well, people still need to exercise and unfortunately there aren't too many choices around. Maybe that explains why they are so spoiled to be arrogant to their customers."
650,1366332,2016-01-31,1,"The salesperson was very professional with scamming people and ran away. Note: if you are interested with the personal training, you have one free training lesson. Don't sign up any document until you read the following comments: Be careful when they asked you to sign up any documents, especially for personal training. Because once you signed, you have to pay them over $200 for over 12 months. What if you signed it unknowingly that it was 1-year contract? Here is what I experienced: On 01/28/2016, one of my friend told me that I may be tricked by LA fitness, and I immediately contacted the gym (just 10 days after I just signed up their paper). I found that basically I was not able to find anyone to help in LA fitness in Stamford: I first told the trainer, the trainer asked me to check the front desk, the front desk asked me to wait for the manager, then the manager said I have to talked to the sales person. So I called the sales person. The sales person passed the phone to a front desk and hanged up my phone. Then I went to the gym again, they said the manager not there and promised to call me the next day. On the next day, no one called me, and I called the gym. When sales person found out it was me again, she said she would call me in 15 minutes. And she hanged up my phone again.So I went to the gym, and the salesperson refused to offer any help and she was very very rude and I strongly believe that she has racial discrimination. The sales manager was very rude when I finally found her in the gym. She made me feel that I signed the contract because I was stupid. Yes, I am a foreign Asian person, maybe stupid because I never trained to treat people that rude when they are rude to me. But that does not mean that should be the reason I should accept the unfair contract which I even didn't realize.. This really makes me feel very frustrated!I never received the contract either by paper or by email. I received a paper from the gym from the sales person, it turns out not the contract of the personal training. I only received a receipt on 01/29/2016 from a front desk of LA Fitness when I realized that they just wanted to steal my money over $200 each month for 12 months. Which was totally ridiculous! Watch out for the sales person in the gym. The only thing they care is to stole money from you. You should be very careful!!! Also, the equipment were bad. Half of them were broken.."
651,1361498,2016-01-29,1,"Their billing practices are criminal, but for some reason I suppose are legal. My debit card number changed, and the first message I received was they could not automatically bill my account. I didn't think twice about it. I called and stated that I didn't want to use their facilities anymore. I thought this was resolved. Somehow, despite my card number changing, they still managed to bill my account their monthly fee. These people are criminal. I have an open complaint with my bank over this, and am more than angry right now. I was told by my bank that Visa pretty much just lets automatic billing continue to process, even if you have changed your debit card number. My personal account was stolen on 3 different occasions last year. (Thanks Target and Home Depot!) I thought that the debit card number change would have prevented said billing on its own. I was told that Visa allows transactions to go through on your old number regardless if it has changed, and 90% of the time, this is a good thing. Maybe I am insane, but if 10% of the time is way TOO much to let go through. Also, what is the point of changing your number, if these idiots allow payments to still go through on a stolen card?In any case, LA Fitness will straight up steal your money. You will be talked down to, and somehow the conversation will result in your problem becoming that you obviously didn't bench press enough or some stupid crap. I swear the people that operate these locations just may be the dumbest people I have ever had to deal with. DO NOT SIGN UP, PERIOD. They do not explain that re-occurring billing cycle, and if you do sign up, you probably signed something that authorizes them to bill you for basically whatever they want. They will not tell you this when you do sign up."

This sales guy Jake opened his mouth, just made a lie saying that the manager would not be on duty, and then I said ""I could give him a call"" and he even refused to take a look at chart of phone number which just put front of him, and he was so rude, said ""YOU googled it up..."" First, I had googled and got phone number and I did get speak with a manager at another location. It proved that Jake made a lie to me. Jake provided unbelievable rude customer services... I would say that it was horrible customer service to LA Fitness members."
653,1342325,2016-01-21,1,"I'm very upset with LA Fitness. First of all I have been in so much stress. I been depressed so my doctor tells me I should do something different in my life. So she tells me ""Why don't you join a gym."" I said ""Ok I might just do that because all I do is stay home."" I clean cook and take care of my 19 month old and wait for my other 3 kids to come home so I can feed them. So yes that is what I have been doing for the past 18 years. I been divorced for almost 3 years. Now I will tell you what happened to me when I visit the gym. I sign my son and myself for the membership then they give me a free session with a trainer. When he is done he tells me to sit and talk about the sessions. He explained like this. ""If you do this sessions it will cost you this much $400."" I said ""ok"". I was thinking about my health that it would be good. So I sign everything he asked me to. I believe him. I trusted him. I thought he was so nice and concern. He never showed me the contract. The other person grabbed the contract and fold it and stapled it on my book they gave me. I should of told him to show it to me but I didn't. How would I of known they would do this to me. Well 3 weeks later I decided to read the contract and to my surprise it said that they were going to take $400 out of my account on the 11 of each month for a whole year. Imagine how I got. I cried all night. I couldn't sleep. I then called and said ""I couldn't do this."" I was lied to. The girl that answer said to me ""Get a job so you can pay for it."" I was in shock. How could she. So the next day I went up there and talk to someone. He told me ""I will try to see what I can do. I will give you a call."" Well he never did call so what I did was closed out my account. I don't know what is going to happen to me for doing that but how would I pay. I have no job. They call me everyday. I just don't answer."

I called again and the first person said they could not do anything and that I had to come in and cancel it then she hung up on me. Well we already did cancel it but they still keep taking money out of his account.

To my surprise there is no personal trainer available at my time to work out 8am to 11am. The most standard times people do go to the gym. Anyhow I been calling corporate headquarters trying to resolve email this. It did not happen. People are very rude and they still want me to pay half of my membership to cancel, even tho I can't use training sessions because of them. Now I'm being charged for nothing or they will send a bill to my credit report. Do yourself a favor, stay the hell away from this place, period. Absolute scammers. You see they only have 1 star from all 1000+ people that complained. I wish I would have seen this before I signed up."

He finished interviews today at 6. He just told me to tell you, you can meet him tomorrow between 10 and 4 pm."" I said, ""No."" He was disrespectful of my time. Not interested. You know, people come and go. Things break and get replenished. But time never gets returned. Your VP wasted my time and texted me to say, ""You showed up at the last possible second for an interview with a Vice President of 40 clubs in LA for the job you're looking to get into, pretty disrespectful if you ask me. Clearly you are not meant for our company."" I will keep these texts for as long as my phone will stay alive. Whoever promoted him to VP should do and/or go through a reevaluation."
657,1313249,2016-01-07,1,"One of the worst financial decision we took in recent years is to fall trap of LA Fitness Training program. We willfully subscribed and hoped to make full use of it. But shortly after my husband had back pain issues and was advised to refrain from physical activities by her chiropractor. After 15 days of round-of-talks, the manager finally paid heed of the request of downsizing the frequency of training. We still left on a happy note with the matter being resolved. This morning, however, our account had transaction the same old amount. On visiting them, entire behavior had turned unfriendly, and manager just dialed a number to speak to 'God-Knows-Who'. Speaking to GKW was just another rude encounter. She said that amount would remain so until we surface medical certificate (which we ourselves offered to provide in the first place). On being told we were never asked so, she mentioned ""read your contract"". Adding more to this, manager said he'd called to inform about the certificate, and we think aliens can help us find where the call was received. All I wish now not to enter that place again. And piece of advice to everyone reading, if you sign for their training program, please read the clause 'if you fall unwell to continue, you are only subjected to our rudeness'."

I have a gym that I've used for several years. I only renew the membership every winter. I prefer to workout outside in the summer. I found out that LA fitness was a new site within 5 minutes from my house, which is perfect. Because the gym wasn't open I called a different location and joined. I was told the gym was opening on 12/17. I wasn't thrilled because I needed to start training for a race, but I dealt with it. The 17th came and went, no opening. I visited the onsite office and was told the gym would be opening 12/22. That date came and went as well. I've driven by the gym several times & it's still not open. I've given up on this gym and will be cancelling and joining another gym. There are many, many others that share the same frustrations as me and have already cancelled. It is unfair that this gym is allowed to pull such scams since they have charged for membership for a gym that has not opened yet and has not date set to open."
660,1301438,2016-01-03,1,"I purchased a personal training package in February 2013 (156 sessions, $5906 - initial payment of $569.00 with 12 payments of $420.00) and used it until I relocated for work in Fall 2013. I bought out my contract in October 2013 after it became clear that with the new job and the difference in gym location that I wouldn't be able to make it in as frequently. When I bought out my contract, the document said that I had 89 available sessions remaining. On the ""Receipt for Training Buyout"", it said ""Sessions available for use, if any, are indicated above."" I was told by the employee that handled the transaction that those sessions would be available when I needed them and would not expire. I explicitly asked about the legal language on the back of the contract regarding cancellations and she said that they don't cancel already purchased and paid for sessions. In 2014, I went through significant physical therapy for back issues (severe sciatic nerve problems) and was unable to make it into the gym at all. (Throughout the entire period, I kept my account current paying $54.99 a month for my membership dues). It's now January 2015 and with my health back in excellent shape I've logged into my account to schedule some personal training sessions at the somewhat nearby Melrose Park club only to find 0 personal training sessions available. Despite the verbal assurances of the employee that handled my buyout, they cancelled all 89 sessions effectively nulling over $3000 worth of purchased training. Absolutely unacceptable by any standard of business and there was no attempt to contact me or warn me about the pending expiration of the sessions."
661,1298870,2015-12-31,1,"I signed my 16 year old daughter up for a membership and asked for personal training so she would get to know the equipment. I was then sent to speak to yet another salesman. I asked for just a few sessions, but he told me it would have to be at least a 3 month membership. To be honest, I don't remember him discussing 12 months, but most assuredly I only wanted the minimum and agreed to 3 months. After several sessions, my daughter told me the sessions were a half hour, maybe 25 minutes. I called and spoke to the salesman, and stated that he had misled me, and I believed that by the price structure, they were an hour (I take personal training at another club, and my half hour session is $35). Certainly $65 should be an hour. I told him I wanted to cancel, but he said I could not cancel until the 3 months were up, BUT to make up for it, he would give me 4 extra sessions, to be completed within the 3 months. After a heated debate I agreed. My daughter finished the # of sessions we had been advised were in the 3 month package, plus the additional 4. After 2 months I realized they were continuously charging my card because I didn't fill out the necessary cancellation paperwork. The salesman never went over that. In fact, while going over the paperwork, he discussed with me how the photocopy wasn't too good, and I told him I couldn't read it without glasses. He read it to me and I signed, of course thinking I was signing up for the 3 months as discussed and verbally agreed to. This company knows exactly what it's doing, and it's a scam. It needs someone to spearhead a class action lawsuit. I will contact all of you if I find someone to take the case! Check back to this site."

They acknowledged cancelling my account, but said a previous family member on the account had not cancelled but had only placed his account on hold (he had left the gym YEARS before).

664,1266341,2015-12-17,1,"This is the most unethical business I have ever had the displeasure of working with. My initial comment is with my specific club, but the closing remarks about their contract practices apply to the company as a whole. Let's start with the quality of the gym. I'm a swimmer, and the pool and the area surrounding it are filthy. I was a member for about three months, and the same dirty band-aid was on the floor of the pool area for that entire time. This is just some of the debris in the area. My major issue is with the staff. The people who work in the front are some of the rudest people I have ever met. I would agree them when I came in and left, and the people barely glanced at me. One girl was on her phone constantly. The real issue is worth the personal training packages. I needed to cancel mine because I lost my job. I knew that I signed a contract and was responsible for the fees, so I'm not upset about that. I'm upset that there was no effort made to help me downgrade to a cheaper monthly package (that was impossible, apparently). When I said I would need to cancel and pay the early cancellation fee, I was told that I just needed to mail in the form that came with my contract and that the corporate office would bill me for the amount owed. They didn't. They continued to deduct money from my checking account. It took me over a month (and lots of bank fees) to get this taken care of. Nearly everyone, from the people at the front desk to the corporate folks I spoke with, were rude, incompetent and unprofessional."
665,1265849,2015-12-17,1,"This is a fact for all LA Fitness gyms nationwide I was told. Their membership policy fees for seniors are neither fair nor ethical. My spouse and I have been members for several years and when I became eligible for the Silver Sneaker program (https://www.silversneakers.com), I was looking forward to a 50% reduction in my monthly cost since LA Fitness accepts this program. I was surprised to find out my spouse's membership increased because both of us were not on the same plan now. Beware. LA Fitness uses unfair principals and policies for their own personal gain and the members are treated like a number, not a loyal customer."
666,1265783,2015-12-17,1,"I am (actually was as of this morning) a member of LA fitness in Dallas (Mockingbird Ln) for a year now. Couple of days ago I walked in and asked for a manager to discuss a concern that I had for my membership. Even before I finished my sentence he said ""NO"" (my request was to use some of the fund I had in training session which I bought before and never used, towards my membership for next 6 months until I am back in town again). As I said he didn't even let me finish my sentence and said ""I cannot refund your money""!!! I realized he didn't even understand my request. I didn't want him to refund anything! So I asked to speak with his manager/superior. He got upset and told me that ""I don't have a manager and I AM the manager!!!"" Again I asked him, ""who is your boss that you have to answer to?"" He responded rudely, ""you don't need to speak with anyone! I am the boss!!!"" At this point I started to feel how unprofessional and rude he is. Then he asked me to leave the club!!! Which I am an active member of (paying monthly membership along with having almost $400.00 sitting in my personal trainer package that has not been used yet). Him asking me to leave the club made me very upset. I told him ""who the heck do you think you are that is asking me to leave?"" He insisted that I leave the club. There were two other employees (trainers) close by noticing the conversation (if you call it that!!). They got involved & tried to help me to see what's going on. At this point I am walking with the trainer towards his desk. He demands the trainer not to even talk to me!!! THUG!! After couple of minutes talking to the other employee I left the club.I called the corporate office & explained the situation. He apologized and told me they will look into it and let me know. Two days later I didn't hear anything. I called back and had to explain the incident again and she reluctantly said a regional manager will contact me. This afternoon I got a phone call from their regional manager. He basically didn't bothered to express any apology on behalf of their employee's behavior. He went one step further and told me I was wrong!!! He didn't offer any solution except freezing my account for one month (which meant lesser monthly fee).He told me because I didn't use my training session, it will expire by end of this year and I won't even be able to use the training sessions that I paid for! (So almost $400.00 is gone on top of all this!!) From my conversation with the regional manager I sensed how callous he is and realized I am not talking to eager professional people so I told him to cancel my membership.I do believe the club has fundamental problem. No wonder the kid (Eric) was acting that way. Obviously he knew nobody will hold him accountable! My complaint was handled very poorly by its regional manager (to say the least). This whole experience made me very concerned about this club called LA Fitness. I feel like they are running the company like bullies by insulting their members and not considering members concerns. I believe their managers (regional and club) lack any basic knowledge of customer service. Unfortunately I don't know much about organizational structure of this establishment, but I am assuming LA Fitness like any other type of business must should about their reputation and having this misfit employees won't help them with that. I will discourage any of my friends to join this club by telling them about my stressful experience."

The women's locker room smells of mildew and sweaty towels that often overflow the towel bin to the point where they are falling on the floor. The sinks are always filthy. There is a locker that has dirty towels in it SINCE THIS PAST SATURDAY. WHY ARE THEY STILL IN THERE??? TODAY IS TUESDAY!!! No janitorial staff is around to wipe down the equipment. The lockers have never been wiped out. The building isn't even two years old and the ceiling leaks... that area has been roped off for over a week now. I have spoken to the operations manager before about the conditions of this ""Signature"" club, and she is usually quite rude and unconcerned. I have asked other people who work there about their short janitorial staff, and each have explained that for whatever reason, the operations manager will not schedule them properly. I am currently trying to figure out how I can have someone come and inspect the facility because this is UNACCEPTABLE. I emailed corporate and their response was to talk to the operations manager. WHY WOULD I DO THAT IF I HAVE ESCALATED MY COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE??? Isn't it obvious that has not worked???"

They allow tennis players to use the racquetball courts. Terrible music played so loud that you are not able to drown it out with your personal music on your earbuds. TVs in every aisle the locker room on different channels played very loud. Mold on the shower walls and shower curtains. Shower drains that are plugged and full of hair. Continually wet carpet in the locker rooms. Where they will not have the courtesy to send out an email blast that the pool is not heated or the whirlpool is not working so you don't go there just to find out that you can't go swimming or use the spa. Managers that ignore you and refuse to provide their manager's phone number or email address (""I will have them email you,"" which never happens). A company where you cannot email or contact the home office. Then this is the place for you!"
669,1255166,2015-12-13,1,"When I joined a brand new LA fitness that was being built in my area, it was not quite completed yet so in order to sign up, you had to meet with a representative out in the parking lot in the freezing cold. He ran my credit card for a total of $260.00 plus one month of training at $34.95 and the next day I went away on a three week vacation. When I returned I had back and spine problems requiring me to go for physical therapy and the place that I go to did not want me working out and possibly destroying the progress they were making with me in order to resolve my situation. Then I found out I also needed foot surgery which is six weeks in a cast and six weeks also needing physical therapy. So needless to say I would not be able to use the gym anytime soon and by April I will be heading up to the Adirondacks for six months to my summer home. So I didn't even get to use the gym once and for the next year I would not be able to, so I went to the LA fitness in my area that finally opened explaining this to them and even brought doctor notes and they refused to return any of my money... Plus I was charged for the month that I signed up now adding up to over $300 dollars!!! They were not sympathetic to my situation at all and are keeping all of my money. With over 800 locations and thousands of members you would think they could afford to return someone's money especially when they never got to use the gym once and they have health issues. So now when I am better and able to join a gym I would never in this lifetime give that money hungry place another penny... The place is a RIP OFF!!!"
670,1250154,2015-12-11,1,"I went to LA Fitness, 3231 Richmond Avenue in Staten Island to sign up on November 3, 2015. I was told about a special (supposedly only good that night till midnight). I was satisfied with the $99 initial fee and $34.99 per month. I agreed and signed up on the computer that evening. As I was signing up, it asked if I wanted a free assessment. I clicked on it to get a start on the gym and the proper exercises that would be good for me. I went the next day and was greeted by ** who would do the assessment. She proceeded to tell me about their personal trainer program. I listened and told her I would like to go home and think about it. She said, ""If you do sign up, would you be using the same credit card?"" I told her I probably would. She said, ""Oh, great, now I need you to sign."" I told her I didn't agree to it yet. Her response was, ""I already put it in the computer"" and went on to say how good the program was. At that point, I agreed to try it for one month and confirmed several times with her verbally that it would be only one month. She confirmed that. I also repeated that several times that it would be a one time fee of $230 and then just my regular $34.99 per month. Again, she confirmed that. I was asked to sign a little credit card machine and she again confirmed it was a one time deal. I left with a book, to record my workout and that's it. I figured my bank statement would be my receipt. December 4, 2015, I looked at my bank statement and saw a charge for $34.99 and $180 from LA Fitness. I called to question them and at first they did not know why. The next day, I was told that I have a year contract that I signed for. How deceitful. I was not given any paperwork nor told that I made a year commitment.I have called several times since then and spoke to ** who did not deny that she lacked showing me the paperwork. Again I informed her that I could not afford this and this was not the conversation we had on November 4. Instead of listening to me, she just kept telling me I should think about giving something else up and that the training is good. She was not getting my point that I did not want a commitment nor could I afford one. Unbeknownst to me, I was emailed a copy of the contract with my signatures from the electronic keypad. Apparently, it went to my spam because I did not receive it. When I was told it was emailed to me, I searched my spam and found it. I would appreciate any help in this matter. I am not the only one that this happened to at this gym. It is a scam and very sneaky of them."
671,1228389,2015-12-02,1,"I went to the gym, no treadmills was available and it's also very crowded. When you call corporate and to help they do nothing but cancel your membership. Grant Ave on Roosevelt Boulevard is the worst."
672,1226781,2015-12-02,1,"I signed up for a personal trainer, which was great, no issues. My issues center around the contract. I am a very meticulous person and I even highlighted and underlined the important focal points of the contract as it was being sold to me. The focus is a contract time of 52 weeks and making payments on time!! On the very last page does it tell you, once the contract ends you will continued to be charged unless a written cancellation notice. To make matters worse, I was offered free sessions as an incentive to join, however no further discussion on the topic was given. Turns out with some cancellations during my 52-week contract by myself or my trainer, all my sessions went over the 52-week contract!! Mind you, those are sessions I paid for, but I would have to pay for additional months to use those sessions otherwise they expire! How ridiculous! It is a perfect way to keep you coming back after the year contract. Who would want to throw any sessions away? Therefore keep buying more months! Turns out this session's expiration is new! Originally you have a year after you cancel your contract to complete the additional sessions without paying for any extra months. It changed midyear during my contract and no I was not grandfathered in. I also hear that they are taking over all 24 Hour Fitness gyms in Arizona. Hmm if this is true, I wonder how they could afford this? Oh, wait... I plan to cancel my full membership. Highly dissatisfied with their selling technique. Not consumer friendly!"
673,1222341,2015-11-30,1,"Nov 2015 my husband and I joined LA fitness and were told we had to speak with a trainer for our first visit. After a brief tour of the gym, the trainer took us back to his desk and showed us his training costs to have a personal trainer to help us meet our goals. We told him we did not want to commit to an additional costly monthly fee. He assured us it was just like the membership, and we could cancel at anytime. Of course that made us feel better about giving it a try on a trial basis. He then had us sign what he said was ""A release of liability"", so, against our better judgment, we signed on a computer signature pad. When I asked for a copy, he said he has to email the copy because the printer didn't work. Needless to say, after a couple of months, my husband and I decided to cancel because of other financial obligations. The manager then shows me a 12 month contract committing to 12 payments of $400 a MONTH, that I signed site unseen from a computer signature pad! Yes, I'm mad at myself for falling for this classic ""Bait and switch"" scam. This is ""in my opinion"", fraudulent misrepresentation and I will be seeking legal counsel."
674,1214697,2015-11-26,1,"I was a member of the LA Fitness in Crestview Kentucky until about an hour ago. I signed my son with me last year and agreed to get a personal trainer at the cost of $280 a month. This summer I had heart problems and had to drop the training sessions. Every month I still paid the $280 a month because I was contracted to. I had surgery for the heart condition in early September. Between the months of August to October, I called and visited the Crestview Facility, trying to get a hold of Mark **, the director of sales there. He didn't return phone calls and was either not there or too busy to talk to me. About two weeks ago, I finally caught him. He told me that my training sessions with LA Fitness were expired, and that I could still get them back if I paid an extra $30 a month. I told him I would get back to him, thinking that the contract had expired and that I would just let it go. This morning I saw the same $280 charge for November come through, so I went down there to talk to him. He immediately got hostile and in my face about my contract, and how it was MY fault that I misunderstood the deal. I was seriously worried he was going to come across the table at me. I stopped talking to him, talked to the other director and it became obvious that this was a corporate issue. I quit my membership immediately and walked out. I plan to go to their customer service and lodge a complaint. Extremely shady business practices."
675,1179312,2015-11-12,1,"About 2 weeks ago my sister-in-law and I went to sign up for a basic month to month membership, Blake, the sales person signing us up for our membership lied the whole time we were sitting in front of him. He told us we would have a $0 signup fee, but instead he ended up taking out $100 out of my card and $220 out of my sister-in-law's card. He made us sign off on our ""contract"" BEFORE it was even shown to us. I basically signed off on something I DID NOT see until after my signature was already taken. After finally going home that same day, I read over the contract, I saw that they give you 7 days to cancel. I called and asked to cancel my membership. They denied it. I asked several times to speak to a manager, and not once did I ever get to speak to him because he was not in the office, nor he would ""return"" my call. 2 weeks later and NO call! I finally called corporate and spoke to 2 different people who absolutely did NOTHING about my issue. They gave me the excuse of ""You signed the contract."" They will not take fault for the bad employee who scammed us into this membership. Now I am suppose to be getting a call back from a VP. This gym is a total scam! They train the employees to sweet talk into something that sounds nice, until you see the final print! Horrible service!! I will be taking legal action if my problem is not fixed!"
676,1164951,2015-11-08,1,"Joined the LA Fitness at 8502 Cooper Creek Blvd, University Park FL, 34201. I signed up for a monthly membership at $34.95 on Sept 30, 2015. The manager I was working with was named **. ** stated it was a month to month contract and that I could cancel any month that I wanted. ** then asked if I was interested in signing up for personal training. I stated ""yes"". ** stated it was $360.00 for 1 month of personal training that consisted of 8 sessions. I stated to ** that I would try it for 1 month. ** then asked me for my debit /credit card. I gave it to ** and he charged me $360.00 for 1 month of personal training. On November 5, 2015 ** called me and stated he needed my credit card number again to charge me $360.00 for personal training. I gave it to him. After getting off the phone I remember that I paid ** in full and wondered why he was charging me again. I called back ** and asked him why he was charging me again and he stated ""The new $360.00 charge is for the new month."" I stated that ""I already paid you when I signed up."" And he stated ""You signed up for 52 weeks."" I said ""No I didn't."" He said ""Yes you did"". I said ""You verbally told me it was for a month."" While talking to ** I remembered that he never gave me a copy of the personal training contract. He said ""I will get it to you later."" I have searched the internet and see that this is a common practice at LA Fitness to scam people into signing up for a year of personal training when they think they are signing up for a month."
677,1158102,2015-11-05,1,"I was looking at a gym to sign up. So I stopped in at the LA Fitness in Burnsville, Minnesota. It's $29.99 month to month club membership. You have to pay first months last months membership which was $85.99 and enrollment. Then once I sign up the manager ask me to buy personal training sessions. He wanted me to buy 96 sessions for $370.00 plus you have to pay the club membership on top of that be about $430 per month just for personal training. No WAY I'm paying that much to use a gym. So they charged my credit card Capital One. I read the contract, you have three days to send in a written notice to the club so I sign up Friday then canceled on Monday. They said weekends don't count as business days. Also when you sign the personal contract make sure you read IT. You have 10 days to cancel. Get out early. So I canceled out on Monday. Then the same manager talked me down to buying 60 sessions - 6 were on him then charged me $260.00 plus $100 enrollment. I cancel that out. I just wanted to sign up for a gym to work out not be pressured buying personal training. Be mindful on what you sign and pay for and the cancellation policies. I called Capital One credit card and explain my problem and told them I was expecting a refund back in full. Capital One told me if I didn't get both refunds back on my credit card by Friday they will help me get my refund back. Great customer service with Capital One, not LA Fitness trying to pressure you to buy personal training. I did check my account today, I got one refund back so waiting for my other one. I will not be going back to this gym because of this or any LA Fitness. Down the road from LA Fitness in Burnsville. At Planet Fitness in Burnsville it's $0 for enrollment and either $10 month or $21 for black card membership. There you get free hydromassage tables, free massage chairs, free tanning and free personal training classes up to 5 people. And it's 24/7 365, they have everything that I want into a gym and I give them a five-star customer review with them."
678,1144527,2015-11-01,1,"I was a member of Bally's for over 40 years. I was transferred to LA Fitness when Bally's closed. I think that the problems that occur at LA Fitness stems from lack of good management. I have gone to several LA Fitness establishments in my area, looking for a reasonable experience. At some, the bodybuilders are in control. They remove pieces from the exercise equipment, like the handles or bars, rendering them useless. They use these pieces in the free weight area, for exercises they were not designed for. When you confront them they blow you off. They will never rack the weights when done. One bodybuilder had 900 lbs. on the leg press. When he finished, he just walked away. I had to help a women member rack the 45 lb. weights, since they were too heavy for her. When you tell management, they do nothing. And when the bodybuilders are done, they never return the handles to the equipment. So you have to walk the floor to find the handles. There are weights scattered all over the floor. The sign says that all weights should be kept in the free weight area. It is not enforced. A major tripping issue. It got so bad that I bought my own handle for the rowing machine. When I put the handle back in my gym bag the other members get mad. I have to explain to them that it is my personal handle. It is pretty sad. There are empty water bottles all over the floor. The members throw paper towels on the floor. The staff does make a half hearted attempt to pick up the debris. It's really all about new memberships. The current members are left to twist in the wind. At one club, I noticed that many members were parking in the fire lane. This is a serious safety issue. If there is a fire the cars will block the fire engines getting close to the building. The sign painted on the asphalt says, ""No Parking in big capital letters."" I brought this to the manager's attention. She acknowledged my concern, but the situation has not changed. I am not sure what the occupancy limit is, but between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. the gym is full of members exercising. I am concerned that if there is a fire, will people be able to leave the facility without getting bottlenecked at the door. Needless to say, I do not go to this gym anymore. I have gone to different LA Fitness Gyms and they all subscribe to the lowest common denominator. Some are better than others, but they are all substandard. At one club, thieves were breaking into the lockers in the men's room. The lockers are made from particle board. Very flimsy. You can break the hinges off with no difficulty. You put the lock you have on the latch, thinking you have security, but it is an illusion. There is a sign in the locker that says LA Fitness is not responsible for loss. So you have to assume the responsibility. The lockers look substantial, but they are very easy to break into. In one week, I saw three members lose their gym bag while they were in the shower. Their wallet, cell phone and car keys. It really boils down to poor management. I would recommend looking for a different gym. Do your homework, and ask your friends about their experience at various gyms they go to. And make sure you get a copy of the contract. Thank you."
679,1121405,2015-10-23,1,"We are writing to express our dissatisfaction and frustration with the LA Fitness Gym and certain personnel in Laurel, MD. My wife and I have been members there since June 2014 and my wife has been denied the ability to successfully complete the Training Sessions that she purchased. Our main complaint is with the Training Coordinator, Ms. **, and her irresponsible attitude toward providing us with a satisfactory level of service. Over a two-month period, documented below, Ms. ** failure to arrange trainers consistently prevented my wife to receive personal training that we had contracted and paid in advance over a 12-month contractual period. Ms. ** lack of customer service skills and her overall unprofessionalism have disappointed us to the point that we had to contact LA Fitness Corporate Office to request a refund of the unused portion of my wife's Training Sessions. To provide some background, my wife, Bernadette ** was initially been scheduled with a female trainer named China (no last name); my wife specifically requires a female trainer to focus on her physical conditioning and training needs. Eventually, communication issues arose between China and my wife. Messages and emails that my wife left for China were ignored or not returned, and when my wife arrived at LA Fitness in Laurel for her training session appointments, China often wasn't present and no substitute female trainer had been scheduled. Sometime around December 2014/January 2015 February we learned that China no longer worked for LA Fitness in Laurel, with no contact from Ms. ** on alternate female trainers available for my wife.Here is a timeline of what transpired over a two-month period: April 13: I called LA Fitness to cancel my wife's Training Session contract ending in May (last payment scheduled for May 14); Ms. ** not available; 85 training sessions unscheduled. April 14: I spoke to Ms. ** who said we must cancel in person and then have only 30 days to complete unused training sessions; we told her that completing 85 sessions in 30 days was unreasonable; Ms. ** said she would request an extension from Corporate. Mid-April: I spoke to Ms. ** to arrange a meeting to discuss details of how my wife could complete her training sessions; Ms. ** had no female trainers available for my wife but would call us when she hired one. April 30: I called Ms. ** again; she said she had hired a female trainer who would start soon.Early May: I called several times for Ms. ** to set-up an appointment with her; she was either unavailable or not working; she didn't return any of my messages. May 25: I finally was able to reach Ms. **; my wife spoke with her at length about our situation; Ms. ** said she requested an extension for my wife to complete training sessions unused; Ms. ** also said I could schedule training sessions as well so we could use up our remaining sessions; Ms. ** set-up an appointment for us to meet her on Friday, May 29 at 5:30 pm to go over details and book our remaining training sessions. May 29: I called in the morning to confirm our scheduled 5:30 appointment and was told that Ms. ** was not working that day. I spoke to the Facilities Manager, Rashiek **, who expressed regret that Ms. ** wasn't available to meet with us; Mr. ** said that only Ms. ** handled training schedules and he couldn't do anything to help us; he promised to relay our disappointment that she had canceled our meeting without informing us. June 1: LA Fitness employee Mike ** called me and said Ms. ** told him to schedule training sessions for my wife and me. I told Mr. ** my wife required a female trainer and he set-up appointments for both of us for Friday, June 5 at 5:30 pm; one session for me with a trainer named Marcus and one for my wife with an unnamed female trainer.June 5: I called in the morning to confirm our scheduled training session appointments. Mr. ** wasn't available but LA Fitness staff person Chris told me he didn't see our names on that day's training schedules and the trainer Mr. ** had supposedly set-up for me named Marcus was not even working that day. I expressed disappointment and asked to speak to the Facilities Manager, Mr. **. Mr. ** again apologized for Ms. ** lack of professionalism and further advised me that I may want to contact the LA Fitness Corporate Office to register my complaints with them directly, as he had no authority over Ms. ** or the training scheduling. Mr. ** gave me the Irvine telephone number, 949-255-7200.June 10: I called LA Fitness Corporate and spoke to Ms. Evelyn **, a Service Manager. I voiced my complaints about LA Fitness, Ms. ** unprofessional and irresponsible service, and the dissatisfaction with the customer service at LA Fitness in Laurel. Ms. ** said she could schedule our training sessions in Laurel; I expressed doubt that she'd be able to successfully coordinate sessions in a Maryland site as disorganized as LA Fitness Laurel.After discussing our options, my wife and I came to mutual agreement that we want a refund of that portion of our fees paid for the unused training sessions. Our lack of faith in LA Fitness Laurel's accountability had been clearly demonstrated over the two months of fruitless negotiations with Ms. **, countless hours spent trying to resolve a simple issue of scheduling training sessions, and Mr. ** inept attempt to schedule even one session. Furthermore, we doubted Ms. ** assertion that she could schedule sessions in LA Fitness Laurel.On June 16, I called LA Corporate and spoke with Miss **, telling her that we want a refund of our paid fees for the unused portion of my wife's training sessions because we had no faith in Ms. ** scheduling any training sessions successfully at LA Fitness Laurel. Ms. ** said that a refund wasn't possible but she could schedule training sessions for us. But could she guarantee that both my wife and I would be able to finish the training sessions with an extension of time? Ms. ** then told me that she could not schedule any sessions for me because my name wasn't on the training session contract. I told Ms. ** that this surprised me because Ms. ** had offered both my wife and me the opportunity to schedule the remaining training sessions in both of our names. When Ms. ** replied that this was not possible and against LA Fitness policy, I asked her why Ms. **, the Training Coordinator responsible for scheduling sessions, would give customers like us promises that were obviously in conflict with LA Fitness policy; Ms. ** had no response.I am certain that you would agree that we have received less than stellar service from the LA Fitness in Laurel, MD. I trust that my detailed account of how we were treated by Ms. ** and others at this facility will alert you to the changes that need to be implemented there. We discovered that there are 904 consumer complaints about LA Fitness. Many of these complaints are similar to ours, telling of poor customer service issues and a lack of professionalism exhibited by various LA Fitness staff persons nationwide. We sincerely hope that this is not the way you want your company to be perceived and steps will be taken to correct these operational deficiencies. We also hope that you will honor our request for a refund of our unused training fees. It is the right thing to do to make amends for the disappointing experience we have had at LA Fitness."
680,1120715,2015-10-23,1,"Here was my horrible experience with LA fitness. Consumer Beware. I have been charged for 15 months (since July 2014) without stepping in the club once. I was assured before moving from Los Angeles by my local club (Culver City In July '14) that everything was taken care of re: cancellation in person. Unfortunately the charges to my account went unnoticed because I rarely use that bank account. When I noticed them in September '15, I called corporate headquarters to speak to an Operations Manager. They told me that there was nothing they could do, although they noted that indeed I had not used the club since July '14. Furthermore, they said that I was due to be charged THAT DAY and there was nothing they could do about it. I told them that I would be filing a complaint and to cancel my account now. I did not accept the 90 day refund they offered (this was a poor attempt at customer service in my opinion) and instead wished to file a complaint. Today, Oct '15, I have AGAIN been charged after the Operations Manager told me that he would notate my account of our conversation and officially end service. I even went online and CHANGED my method of payment but they went back to my old bank account to charge me again. What I noticed, upon searching through my email, what they did was send out an automatically-generated corporate email that went directly into my spam folder so I missed it. Not only did they NOT cancel my account in September '15, they sent me something that said I gave them permission to continue billing me as usual because I had 'updated' my account over the phone (could not be further from truth or intent). Furthermore, they sent me an auto-generated email directing me to print out forms and mail them in if I do wish to cancel my account. A bit of a double standard with their communication policies and expectations, to say the least. This goes beyond poor customer service. It is tantamount to corporate theft. As a customer who has contributed to your gym for many years, and has been a member to a variety of gyms for over a decade with zero problems, I expect reparations to be made. I will be making this issue as public as possible."
681,1116128,2015-10-21,1,"Since being in gyms for over 22 years I joined Hollywood El Centro LA Fitness - been horrible experience ever. Mexican gang members harassing clients on floor and overcrowded gym, rude staff, untrained staff, dirty gym and no management skill."
682,1115996,2015-10-21,1,"LA Fitness- Cranston: I would advice you not to join this gym. They tell one lie after the other. I had signed up for personal training and was told there was no commitment and I could stop at any time. I was also led to believe the training session would be for an hour. Well they are $65.00 for 25 minutes. Brandon, who signed me up wouldn't not give me a copy of the contract. I cancelled in June and he assured me I was cancelled and I double checked with him in July and he assured me I was all cancelled because I had no contract. It was a bunch of lies. Brandon has since been fired for his unethical practices. In October I noticed I was still being billed. The gym agreed to refund my $440. Another lie, not only didn't they not refund me, they billed me another 220. They then called corporate and they said I couldn't get a refund but would cancel my future training sessions and I would NOT have to pay a buy out fee because it was a Branson issue-another lie! I checked several days later and even asked for it in writing but I was told I didn't need it, I've been cancelled. Well I go to schedule my 11 training sessions that I don't want at another location and am told I will be having 4 more at the end of the month. And I wasn't cancelled. That manager called a man named Carl, who is the district manager. He denied telling anyone that I didn't have to pay a buy out fee. If I wanted to stop being billed I would have to pay the fee. I paid it to get rid of this nightmare. I called corporate. They were very rude. I was told that I should be grateful I could buy out at a discount. I spoke to Carl this morning in person, he's just as ignorant as corporate. I have 4 training sessions left, that I'm taking next week and then I'm never going back. I already have a new gym lined up. My advice is not to join any LA fitness. They will promise you the world, but will never deliver. If you do decide to join, BUYER BEWARE. I'm also contacting the attorney general on this company."

684,1103981,2015-10-15,1,"Buyer beware. The contract is not well done and has a ""gotcha"" quality in their fine print. There is also a double standard in that LA Fitness requires correspondence in writing and they feel that emailing you is adequate. I discontinued a contract and was notified via email I had 30 days to complete the remaining 11 sessions. I missed that email and nowhere was I told there was a time limit. I had terminated a contract before some years ago and had those sessions stored. The fine print says that they no longer provide that service so I am SOL. My advice would be to stay away from the training at LA Fitness unless you are willing to be taken to the cleaners."

They blast terrible music, and the front desk staff are extremely rude and unprofessional. I've worked customer service and I've dealt with bad customer service, but the unprofessionalism of LA fitness is ridiculous. And there are numerous policies which tries to prevent you from cancelling your membership. You can only cancel your membership 1 week prior to your billing date. You must cancel one month in advance. You can only cancel from 9am-5pm. However, you can sign up for a membership anytime of the day. Needless to say it took me three attempts to get my membership cancelled."

687,1088284,2015-09-25,1,"If they weren't so cheap and located everywhere I travel for work I would quit. I always struggle with LA Fitness because their corporate policy and their behavior at the gyms is so unprofessional and so very poor. We are bodybuilders and constantly see bodybuilding and posing classes happening at other LA fitness around the country. When we try to schedule a posing class local corporate office tells us ""no we don't do bodybuilding posing classes at any LA fitness's, corporate policy"". If I lived in Washington I could sign up on social media to pose at an LA fitness - **. This gym has hosted several posing classes in the 1+ years it's been open, one of which I participated in w/o issue, but according to the gym that was unsanctioned. This was thrown at us again when we first started. We were sold training classes under the direction of a Training director who said ""Yes we can train a bodybuilder"". Their 2 bodybuilding trainers quit w/in 6 months of me signing up. Now I have 100+ sessions of training I will never use because they have decided to no longer cater to clients that want to build big muscles or body build. It is disappointing to talk to the AVPs of the club, someone such as Nick **, who was so interested in bodybuilding and telling us all about the body builders that worked for LA fitness and competed for LA Fitness and tried to help us, but as soon as we left sent us to corporate so that corporate could use their usual lingo to deny us. Easy to deny someone when you are in California and on the phone.Training Manager ""Al"" is great, but Manager Greg does not like to have any documentation of his words/actions, so be careful as he is inclined to try to swipe your phone from your hand. Greg is also very passive aggressive. When issues arise he will text you his issues as opposed to picking up the phone and calling you. In my mind that is not how you do business in this day and age. It's sad to watch this really nice gym start to become a planet fitness type environment. Weights are not put away, staff is disrespectful, staff makes promises they know they can't keep and/or go back on their words to save their **.I suppose I should expect this from a gym that likes to overcharge, has poor practices to cancel their memberships and has almost a 50% turnover rate. It's too much to expect good service when the company is only invested in making money. For everyone's future reference - if you have an issue with any of the staff their email's are firstname.lastname@fitnessintl.com; so you can reach anyone whose name you can find."
688,1087051,2015-09-24,1,"LA Fitness is the worse gym to get a membership with. I called them and asked them to CANCEL my membership, then I was charged 280 dollars for trainer fees. I don't have access to the gym but I'm still being charged monthly. I spoke with Ashley and Chris from corporate. I explained my situation and made her aware I can no longer afford the membership and I have a doctor's slip preventing me from using that facility. Ashley told me that they will not CANCEL my contract because I signed it. Then she hung up on me. I told her I would buy out my contact, however if I'm still being charged I won't be able to afford the buy out price because I was recently evicted from my apartment because of the last 280 deduction."
689,1086807,2015-09-24,1,"My wife suffered a medical incident that prevents her from using the gym, but LA Fitness did not care. You have to be ""Totally Disabled"" to cancel your personal training program in order to get any money back. This will cost us thousands of dollars as we took out an annual bi-weekly personal training program. To make things worse we had to pay another $600 tonight to cancel the next 3 months left of the annual bi-weekly program. I suggest you do not get one of the yearly training programs with a trainer. If anything happens to you that prevents you from using the gym you will be out a bunch of money unless you are ""Totally Disabled""."
690,1084070,2015-09-20,1,"GHETTO! Atlanta LA Fitness clubs are rough. At other health clubs, there are strict rules that members must follow, for YOUR SAFETY, and out of consideration of other members. At LA Fitness, rules are not enforced. With that come fights, filth, and the risk of being locked up after hours, by the apathetic staff. When you walk in to any LA Fitness, and you plow through people on cellphones. You wade through garbage on the floor, and you risk breaking your foot or your neck by tripping over weights left on the floor! If you want to use a piece of equipment, you have to wait until someone gets off the phone. If you ask them to move, they get mad. ""OMG! I'm ON THE PHONE!"" When you are in the free weight area, you have to worry about someone on the phone walking into you. People with hands free phones are the most dangerous, because they have two arms to wave around, like a wounded albatross! There is a contest to see who can be the loudest on the phone. When you are trying to concentrate, there is some loud-mouth on the phone nearby, acting like a little Donald Trump trying to close a deal, on the price of eggs in China. There's no room in the locker rooms because of people hanging out, playing with their phones. Cellphones have cameras. If you want to take a picture of me changing clothes, ask first! People don't put up their weights. You never can find weights. Weights are scattered all over the floor, and the dumbbells are scattered across the gym. People load up the bars and leave them. If you have limited time to work out, most of your time will be used hunting for weights, or putting up other people's weights."
691,1077589,2015-09-11,1,"LA Fitness gyms are franchises. Sales people tell chumps they are part of a national organization. Quality will vary at each location. NO PRIVACY. Cell phones allowed in locker rooms. People shower at home. Most employees are sales people who provide no assistance to members: ignorant about safe use of equipment. No towel service. You must bring towel to clean equipment after sweat hogs use it. Not an adult club, moms dump teenagers there. Get good earbuds: infomercials 24/7, lousy TV programming, no local sports. Avoid long term contracts. Ask for how many members join and quit. Constant pressure to buy personal trainer time. Annoying calls at home. No assistance for seniors or disabled.

However, when I moved to Northern California there was not a gym in the area. Over the past 30 years, I would attempt to keep my membership up when I was in Southern California. I never had any prior problems with Bally's or Holiday Health Spa. I quickly found out that LA Fitness refused to renew my membership due to failure to prepay membership renewal. The only membership I was offered would be a new membership at an incredible price increase. I contacted the corporate office and was told that they would assist me with my renewal. However, 5 days later, my renewal was not updated in the computer. I contacted the corporate office again. After being told that they would honor my renewal, now I was told that they have no record of my initial contact and my renewal was denied."

Again, Amber was OFF the clock, eavesdropped and was unhappy with my peer’s OPINION of that particular LA FITNESS in regards to unprofessional customer service. In conversing with every right of our personal opinion, AMBER eavesdropped and overheard our personal opinions and decided to take it upon herself to personally attack my peers. Amber felt the need to ask for my peer’s name to take action to step to his face in an unprofessional matter, invading his personal space. In full attack mode versus a more appropriate approach, Amber felt the need to express she did not like my peer’s comments and take action to say my peer is no longer welcomed in the facility. Not only was Amber unprofessional (NOT IN HER WORK CLOTHES, OFF DUTY) but instead of taking a more professional approach to possibly sit down to discuss the issue that she ""overheard"", along with the fact Amber accused my peer to be impersonating trainer-like actions. When did a gym turn into a ** camp, with ""managers"" hawking over ""PAYING"" customers who are seeking to come to a gym to relax, talk amongst each other, and overall enjoy the gym experience. What I will say is that this location is extremely unprofessional and I do not appreciate referring over ten members to this gym and then be personally attacked. Needless to say I will be canceling my membership and this location particularly left a terrible taste in my mouth."

697,1070224,2015-08-31,1,"This is a failing gym that employs high-pressure tactics to lure unwitting new customers in. Customers are pressured to sign now, with a 3-day rescission period and a required first and last month paid for in advance. This period is unrealistically short, and the 2-month payment necessary, as anyone who actually uses this center will quickly find out that the facilities are average and the class teachers are poor. In fact, I have seen these teachers take classes and attend a nearby, competing gym during their off hours. A call within the week to the Orange County office requesting a cancellation is quick and easy (they do this a lot?), but no refund of the 2 months' fees are ever granted. This particular location should be investigated and shut down by the Attorney General of CT!"
698,1069515,2015-08-30,1,"I joined City Sports in October. I signed up for personal training for 12 month (4 times a month). Everything was going great until they decided to promote my trainer to Master trainer. At which point they wanted to charge me an extra $80 a month. I cannot afford that. They never set me up with a new trainer nor will they let me out of my contract. They have been taking money from my account for the past 3 months without providing ANY services. After months of ignoring my calls, I was finally able to get a new trainer. I liked the guy and was ready to get into my routine again. After training me once, he asked me to send him my food diary and what a typical workout week is for me. I did all this. He was also going to send me a new routine for my weekend workouts. Nothing... Once the weekend started and I had nothing, I followed up with an email. He said he was also promoted to Master trainer. Unfortunately, I wasn't informed of this until after texts and emails. My final email asked if he was still training me on the Monday Training for that week. I sent a message back asking if he is training me. No answer... It's now Sunday and I looked at my account and see that I have NO TRAININGS SCHEDULED. They must have deleted my scheduled workouts when he was promoted. No introduction to a new trainer. No notice until after several texts and emails. I've tried to get out of my contract but they state as long as they have someone able to train me that they are not in breach of contract and somehow I am to strong arm the head trainer there into giving me a trainer who will show up."

Pay 366 month for personal trainer. 6 month down the drain doesn't have time to schedule me in. It weird how he schedule me in last minute when my work schedule is opposite. Lost almost two months of session because he can't schedule me in. They have been charge me without me even knowing I was to show up in session. I made a complaint to corporate. Didn't even care. All they did is switch me in different location. It wasn't even in the right one. Even more mad I just want to cancel. They didn't even give me my money back I lost in session. It ripped off. Never trust LA Fitness. I need help to get my session I was charged without me knowing. It not right. Corporate didn't do nothing about it. Phoenix Arizona I need help getting my money worth I lost.
702,1068596,2015-08-28,1,"I have been a member for about 3 years since the opening of the LA Fitness in Randolph, NJ. The reason for this is that your clubs SUCK!! I run (3) small business and have never seen such an operation. Here are a few things at this club that made my husband quit and go to a different fitness club: Locker rooms are filthy the showers have not been cleaned properly. The saunas have NEVER been cleaned, the women's is so gross I will not even go in it anymore. It took almost (3) years for the carpets to get cleaned. I know because I was there 1st thing in the morning. It happened after I told the new person how filthy it was. The machines are only cleaned by (1) gentlemen who I see cleaning in the early morning. The group room the mats are gross; we watched as spit was on one for (3) months until we finally cleaned it. The floor in the group room is not cleaned once a day or once a week. You see the same hair and fuzz on the floor for most of the week. The Hot Tub Whirl Pool or whatever you want to call it has been broken now for 6 straight months. It maybe worked a total of 6 months out of the entire time this club has been open. The pool sometimes has no heat!!! The AC does not come on until about 11:00 am and the group room is so hot when you have Zumba people are ready to pass out. Really tired of hearing about Corporate. If this is your corporate policy you deserve to get sued. Something as simple as a battery in a clock takes (3) weeks to change. Speaker in the Group Room broken for (2) months.Staff turnover that you get use to an instructor and then they are gone, replaced by someone who is not as good. Zumba has gone from Malena wild to some of the most boring instructors. The only instructors are Enida who has less classes and Lauren, the rest you can keep. Same in spin and the fitness group sessions. We have all but stopped taking them. The shining star are your Yoga instructors. There should be someone cleaning every day all day both the women's and the men's bathrooms and staffing should be on hand to clean the machines. There should be a night staff that cleans at least 3 times a week.This is a busy gym, the evenings and Saturday mornings it's hard to get a machine or work out in the weight area. Originally the Personal training area was in the front by the employee desk. The area in the back had weights/mats and machines for mat workouts. Then they changed it and made the personal training area in the larger space. On a Saturday or in the mornings the new space is so full of useless ab machines and there are no mats or weights to do any kind of workout.We also signed up with your personal training. The gentlemen told me he would be my trainer. My husband and I only signed up for it because this trainer said he was going to train us. Well after he signed us up, he left and I was told that he was not supposed to be training people because he was the manager. HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW THAT. So you got us for $1,440.00 for the contract. It took me a year to find a trainer that was the kind I was looking for. Rodney is an excellent trainer and not one of the run you through the machines and not correct your form. I have to say Rodney, Kurt and Mario were the best trainers there but of course like most of the other good staff they left.Staffing: When we were told we could no longer use the back area to train because it was only for Personal Training we were upset and the response we got was go to another gym. This is what you get when you do not pay people the worth of their time. As company I would think you would want to retain your members and staff. Unfortunately this place changes staff on a weekly and monthly basis. I have been a member longer than any of the staff that is currently at this LA Fitness location.Not that you really care but I come only for the people whom I have met and work out with. Once their memberships are up we will all be moving to a different gym. We are about 12 people. Staffing is everything you are in a customer-based business. I noticed that all the complaints we have noted are the same in other clubs, so I am guessing this is a corporate thing."
703,1068249,2015-08-28,1,"I've had the same gym membership since 2002 with Bally Total Fitness Center. Now that LA Fitness bought Bally Total Fitness. I have been to multiple locations in Tampa and now in Lutz because the smaller gym locations are closed. The gym in Lutz is always dirty! I don't work out there on the weekends because the locker room is so filthy from the Friday before! The issue I am having with this company is men walking into the locker room (accidently), management & the cleaning lady allowing maintenance men to fix broken water fountains, toilets, ceiling, and whatever else they can think of to be fixed while women are showering, changing their clothes or in general getting ready for work.On one occasion I walked into the locker room and a maintenance man was fixing the water fountain while women were wrapped in their towels blowing drying their hair and changing their clothes. When I asked the women ""did they know a man was in the locker room"" one said ""yes the cleaning lady told me"", the others blow drying their hair and showering said they ""did not know"".I've occurred this situation again on 08/27/2015 & 08/28/2015, men in the locker room fixing a hole in the ceiling. The entire time this was happening the cleaning lady was talking to the maintenance men, she failed to mention this as we entered the locker room, I only knew because of the signs that read ""Men in locker room"" (Note: these signs are not placed outside of the locker room but inside, therefore you do not know someone is in the locker room until you have entered).On 08/27/2015 there was an older woman about to change her clothes in a back corner and I recommended she do not change her clothes out in the open. Shortly after I said this another male walked from the bathroom area. We both changed our clothes in the shower area. Please note, this is happening throughout the week around 7:00am - 7:30am normal hours for patrons of this club or any club to shower and start their day.I do not understand why management cannot make an executive decision to proceed with repairs before or after hours. Secondly, why is LA Fitness allowing the cleaning lady to make the decision whether or not the locker room is clear and/or safe for maintenance men to do repairs? My membership is paid for a year 08/2015 - 08/2016 and if I am not mistaken, I paid for safety and privacy in their establishment!At this point I am fed up and I feel completely unsafe! I do not know if or when I will walk out of the shower with a towel around my waste and a man or men will be in the locker room, shower or restrooms fixing broken items that can clearly be fixed before or after hours! I am also reporting this to the Better Business because at this point I feel like this is normal practicing procedures for this location and its staff."
704,1068092,2015-08-28,1,"The personal trainers at LA Fitness, representing Pro Results, misled and lied about the amount of money I agreed to pay when signing up for a personal training program. They are hustlers and con-artists and their practices are illegal."
705,1067549,2015-08-27,1,"I had a membership with LA Fitness and just recently my debit card on file expired and I had not been there to workout since that happening. I received multiple calls a day from LA Fitness requesting I update my billing information so that my membership would not be interrupted which was annoying, and I also received a few emails which was fine until recently when I checked my bank account to find that LA Fitness had weaseled its way in and charged my bank account directly. I'm upset because I never gave them my bank account information and if they followed their policies correctly my membership would've been cancelled or frozen. They would not have charged my checking account. I'm done with LA Fitness and just mailed in my membership cancellation form this morning. They are a disgusting company with disgusting practices. Do not use them. They will find any way possible to suck money from you."
706,1067271,2015-08-27,1,"WORST GYM EVER! They will lie and cheat just to get a sale as evident by an employee's post on his twitter account. Avoid this company at all cost, I emailed customer service and executive relations, no one ever responds."
707,1065266,2015-08-24,1,"If you are looking for a clean gym with a reasonable price tag then this is your place. Just be aware, if you need customer service of any kind, stay away, far away. I signed up for Personal Training at this gym and was happy enough for the first 4 months. Then they had a shortage of trainers and I was unable to use my sessions during a time that worked within my schedule. Trainers are only available Monday through Friday, not on weekends, and during the summer of 2015 they only had 1 trainer on staff. I put up with this for about 8 weeks until another trainer was assigned to the gym but that trainer stood me up. I asked the front desk where the trainer was and ""they didn't know"" so I worked out on my own for an hour waiting for her, she never showed. When I went looking for answers I was given the runaround, promised phone calls from the VP that never came, and was greeted with rude employees at every turn.After finally getting in touch with corporate, and a few more failed promises at phone calls from the VP, I finally was able to get in contact with him (10 days of phone tag later). I concluded that this company does not respect their customers and wanted to cancel my plan. The VP let me out of the contract without a buyout but did not refund any of the sessions I was unable to use due to the unavailability of trainers in his gym. He would not even refund the 4 sessions I was billed for while he was not returning my phone calls.Bottom line - this company will expect you to uphold your end of the contract but they do not have the uphold their end. They do not need to speak to you with respect or answer your questions in a timely manner. If you don't need to deal with customer service at all, then this gym might be okay. But if you do, then good luck."
708,1056969,2015-08-13,1,"I have been a member of LA Fitness, going to the Oxford Valley location for over 10 years, almost since they opened. Initially, it was a beautiful club, with new equipment and a staff that cared. I miss those days. This place has so many problems, I'm not even sure where to start... Broken equipment (loose belts on treadmills, non-functioning treadmills and ellipticals). Theft (lockers and cars broken into, bad enough they occasionally hire rent-a-cops to patrol). Poor environmental upkeep (mildewed rugs, dirty equipment, hot and humid in summer after it rains). Ants in sauna (since 2006!). Men's locker room a pig style (used to be nice, now humid, trash and powder all over floor daily). Trash on floor throughout facility. Parking lot looks like Times Square the day after New Year's Eve with trash everywhere. Beware parking lot speeders! Serious danger! Been hit once, countless close calls. Unclean members (seriously smell TERRIBLE, management doesn't care, even when notified). Poor staff organization (they have sales, front desk, and janitorial---nobody for guest issues). Staff cop-out to any issue is ""We can't change it, that's what corporate says we have to do"". I know how good this gym could be, but management (and THEIR manager) don't seem to care. It's a shame. If you don't belong, you need to check out the other options in the area. Don't be fooled by the smiling salespeople. The moment you sign up, they can't remember who you are. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! And pass the word, don't let your friends make the mistake of joining either!"
709,1056667,2015-08-12,1,"I'm a member of LA fitness for several years. Recently I and other of my friends are having problems with management when working out in groups. Management threatens every male friend who cross trains with us, saying they can not cross train with a group a girls. Gym supposed to be a fun place where you go to meet friends and learn from and help each other. A stress free zone and not a place where you told who you can or cannot work out with. I'm not sure if these is a LA fitness policy or out of control management, but it's running our happy environment since we can't work out with our friends."
710,1054548,2015-08-10,1,"On August 10, 2015 I started my workout at the Poway LA Fitness and when I started working on the step master, the machine ejected me at a super speed that pushed me out. The stop bottom was not even working. I saw this happened to 2 more ladies and went to ask the manager on duty, who send an employee to unplugged. But did not put a sign preventing other from using it. I keep telling people not to plug it and averted them off the danger. I went again to ask them for a sign. They said there too many things to do. Is now 12:35, they have done nothing. So if someone get hard, is on Melissa the sales manager and the LA Fitness manager on duty for not listening and preventing something potentially dangerous."
711,1053891,2015-08-10,1,"If you are considering joining this particular LA Fitness club or any other LA Fitness, please read my story and ask yourself, ""Do I want to become involved with a company that does business in this manner?"" And if your answer is NO, then spare yourself the headache and run far away from this business. On July 1, 2015 I signed a personal training package contract with LA Fitness for 4 sessions a month, $160 a month, for 12 months ($1920 total). I negotiated, read and signed this contract and was emailed a copy of it. When I showed up for my first session the personal trainer, the same man who sold me the contract named Hanz, suggested that we move my sessions up so that initially I see results faster and once I've reached the fitness goals we discussed, the sessions decrease in frequency. I was told that I have the freedom to schedule my sessions with my trainer and the first session was scheduled between me and Hanz via text messages going directly back and forth between our two cellphones. When I showed up for my second session he was a no-show. I was told by gym management that he is sick and all of his sessions for the week have been canceled.When I showed up for my 3rd session on 8/3/2015 (which was now being scheduled via LA Fitness' automated emails) I was told that he no longer works at this location. Currently I am not certain he is still employed with the company. I was also informed that Hanz ""upgraded"" my package to 12 sessions a month, $280 a month, $3360 annually. I was surprised by this. So I objected and informed the manager I never consented to an ""upgrade"". I never signed a new contract featuring these terms, nor did I authorize the charges on my credit card. The manager said he would look into it. Next thing I know, I receive an automated email stating my package has been upgraded to $480 a month. I called the manager (Tyler) and he informed me he was simply showing someone at the corporate office how this can be done to a contract with ""a click of a button"".This was the last time I was able to speak to anyone at this particular LA Fitness location. This business is now holding me to a contract I have neither asked for, seen, read, given its terms and conditions, signed or been given a copy of. In fact, currently, I am not even certain if it is for $280 a month or $480 a month, how many sessions a month I have, at what cost per session, and for how long. In July of 2015, I was charged $280. In August of 2015 I was also charged $280. I will not be surprised if on 9/1/2015 I am charged $480.Making matters worse, this business sold me a service they cannot provide because they do not have enough trainers. The manager attempting to understand what Hanz had done informed me that I need to drive to their Denton location and schedule my sessions 3 weeks in advance if I wish to receive this service. On July 1, 2015 when I signed the initial contract, the fact that I need to drive to Denton to receive the service I signed up for in Highland Village was never mentioned. If it had been, I would never have signed the initial contract. The existence of an upgrade policy was also never mentioned to me and does not appear anywhere in the written contract. If I had known about this policy I would have been cautious of it and I would never have consented to it.On a side note: While voicing my complaint to the club's health and wellness manager, Tyler, I asked to see both his and Hanz' certifications as personal trainers. I was informed that they are both master trainers and highly certified but neither one of them could produce a certificate to collaborate these claims. I find this extremely troubling since most professionals, including pedicurists, manicurists, doctors, lawyers etc, post their certificates in a way that is visible to all clients who enter their facilities but the LA Fitness trainers think that they are too good to afford the same courtesy to their clients and the LA Fitness Corporations condones and encourages this conduct. So far I've filed a complaint with BBB as well as the FTC. I've also spoken to my attorney, bank and informed the Highland Village Police Department of my fears regarding CC Fraud and been given a reference number. So, do you still want to do business with this corporation?"
712,1052131,2015-08-07,2,"The new LA Fitness that opened up was viewed as a great opportunity. However, within the first 6 months, everything began to fall apart. The elevator was left disabled for 2 months, causing all impaired people to attempt to use the stairs, causing a health hazard. For the SilverSneakers classes, there is little equipment and no chairs, causing another hazard that nearly caused me to fall. LA Fitness is clearly non-responsive to complaints, and ignores health and safety hazards."
713,1051174,2015-08-06,1,"I had a 12 month contract for personal training. I signed up because the gym was right around the corner from my house. However I was moving downtown in a couple of months, the people there assured me that there are definitely locations downtown I could transfer to. Stupid me, I did not research that first, and found out later there are zero locations downtown. Clearly they did not care and just wanted to make the sale. At the end of the 12 months, I used barely any of my appointments because it was too far and too much of a hassle. Of course in the fine print they have something saying unless you cancel 30 days prior to the end date, your contract will be automatically renewed. Luckily I caught this and I gave plenty of notice, in writing. At the end of my contract, I got charged on the 13th month, and when I called they acted like I never gave any notice and didn't have record of it. They are extremely unorganized there. I had to call for a couple weeks trying to get a refund, and the manager kept on promising to call me back, and never would. I ended up calling every few days and he would keep saying he's looking into it and getting back to me. Finally on the third week he said the refund will be processed. Then on the 4th week and I called and apparently the refund never got processed or even sent to the accounting department. Not sure what he did with it. At that time, 4 weeks in, he said he would send it out right away, following that it will take 8-10 business days to get into my bank. Said he would call me on Tuesday to update. No call received, now I am calling back Thursday and the people there just say he's busy but they will leave a message, and if I don't hear back by Monday, then call again. Absolutely ridiculous. They just take advantage of having people's banking information, and just hope that we won't notice, or after weeks of fighting for a refund to be given, maybe we will give up. It's gross and it's theft."
714,1049867,2015-08-05,1,"My friend invited me to go to LA Fitness as her guest. I forgot to bring my ID with me and the sale manager told us to meet him and he will figure a way out. There we sat down and he started all the hard sell. Such as there is no way he could have let me into the gym if I don't sign up for gym membership. And what pissed off my friend the most and also made her to cancel her gym membership was the sale manager, Steve **, said ""If I let your friend in as a guest tonight and she is satisfied with the gym facility, then I will charge your credit card for additional premium."" This is totally unacceptable. That's not the way to deal with customers, my friend cancelled her gym membership right at the moment. We both walked out the gym furious and decided to tell every one of our friends and colleagues how rude and horrible service we received at LA Fitness. And strongly discouraged any of them to sign up for the membership. Because with that monthly premium, you deserve better service and better gym somewhere else."
715,1048328,2015-08-03,5,"I purchased a membership with LA fitness at the end of May 2015. At that time, I provided LA fitness with my personal information, including my personal cell phone number. Soon after, I was contacted by LA fitness personnel regarding a free orientation I could attend on the weekend. I agreed to attend. Soon after, I was again contacted by the same female employee concerning the same matter. This time I was contacted, I was actually on the driving on Highway 5 freeway. I pulled over since this was her second or third attempt to contact me within a few hours that day. I was shocked that it was an LA fitness person wanting to talk about a free orientation which supposedly had already been scheduled. At that time I expressed my displeasure and frustration to the employee saying that they should keep a record of who they call and all that jazz. I asked her very politely to please not call again since this was the second time she had called, and she had called in a very inappropriate time. That employee did not listen. She called again at the most inappropriate time while I was driving on the freeway. I almost got into a wreck this time. I pulled over to find out who was calling and it was that dumb woman again. I could not believe it. Once I realized that it was that LA fitness employee, I hung up the phone. I call that harassment. I called back to LA fitness and asked to tell that woman not to call back again. I also stopped using their services. They later requested payment for the following month's dues for services I no longer received. I am refusing to pay for those unused services. The employee's inappropriate behavior stems from LA fitness' lack of training or lack of supervision of their untrained and uneducated associates. Thanks."
716,1046951,2015-08-01,1,"They misrepresented what I was signing. Told me it was permission to auto-draft my acct, instead they took $259 enrollment fee from my account and told me I signed a 1-yr contract for personal training."

My local clubs are excellent, however, 18 months ago I start attempting to setup my online access and it appears to have some bad info in my online account therefore I can't login. I have now called for assistance over 15 times and written a letter which they will not accept, re-mailed again to the corp office and they still refused to accept it. I am at my end of what is a little CS issue that should take one minute to fix it and I was not happy with the local gyms I would left over this lack of professionalism. Fix my online access member number **."

I'd have to pay 50% of my remaining charges for 3 months. Fast forward and I see another charge on my account. This time 'Kristin **' told me to do what 'Denise' said 4 months ago. I contacted the club by phone and was told that because I hadn't sent a formal request the account was now month to month. Lies! I sent a formal request and that was why the membership was cancelled. I won't EVER do business with them again. I won't support anything they are associated with."
719,1044376,2015-07-29,1,"Yesterday July 28, 2015 I was ask to share a lane in the pool that I was swimming in. Note that the lane was less than 6 ft wide. Normal swimming lanes in Olympic pools are 86"" wide or over 2 meters wide. I advised the manager that I waited each and every time I came in the pool for a free lane so I had sufficient space to swim. (I hit the ropes now with just myself in the lane.) She advised me that the area between the ropes 1 lane was 2 lanes. I told her she was not correct that the lane is between the ropes. She said ""I am the manager and I should know."" I agree she should know what entitles a lane first of all. She went on to tell me people were waiting to swim. (No so to swim as the people waiting just bobbed up and down in the water and walked around in the lane.) Several people could share a lane with no issue as they were not really swimming. The conversation went on with the manager telling me I was allowed only 20 minutes in the pool. 20 minutes? Are you kidding me. I am sold a membership with the understanding I have full use of the facilities. No I am told only 20 minutes in the pool because people are waiting. I was given examples of other equipment that I would be required to get off a treadmill if people were waiting. Will they ask me to share a shower stall with someone because people are waiting? What about men and women sharing a common locker room because of some space or usage issue. This appears to me to be over selling the club and they are not able to accommodate the members properly. In other words once you pay your money then they push you out of the way for the next person with money in hand.I was a member for a total of 6 weeks at this point. I signed up to swim. No weights, no racketball, basketball or anything else. I was swimming as instructed by my doctor for health reasons to help my bronchitis. In addition to that short time I have not had use of the pool for a total of 8 days and the spa has been shut down for an additional period of time for over two weeks. I was told maintenance was done only during the day. I ask why not at night when no one is there. Also when an organization has as many clubs as they have they should be able to solve the problems faster than they do.The clubs should shoulder total responsibility for overcrowding and not punish its members. I had ask about someone making arrangements for me to go over to another location when the pool was not available. No one bother to address that as I was just ignored as another old man I guess. Yet I was reminded that because I got loud with one of the members about the lane that I was yelling. If you yell you get their attention but they may call the police and have you removed. I was advised that my membership would be revoked and I was not to return to that location and I would never in my lifetime be able to join another LA Fitness anywhere in the United States. I could also say the staff was rude, place in disrepair, dirty and all the standard 900 + complaints that were listed before me. ALL I CAN SAY IS JUST DON'T JOIN. If you Google 10 best health clubs LA Fitness is not even on the list.I do not see any issue about waiting. The people that were waiting were retired as I was. They did not have a job to go to. It was 2 in the afternoon. I considered it rude for them to even ask if I would move over so they can share the lane. Now I have always been one to help others and to share and even wait my turn but this is not one of those situation that is conclusive to that. The end of this matter resulted in the manager calling the police and have me thrown out of the pool for swimming. I am 68 years old and to be removed from a club that I paid for usage of by the police is going a little far."
720,1042549,2015-07-27,1,"LA Fitness makes it very difficult, or for them - hopefully impossible, for you to cancel. You can't call in to cancel. You can't cancel in person. You have to send in some little piece of paper in the mail to some address. And you have to put your own stamp on it. And the piece of paper doesn't look like it is mailable anyway. After I did this, they still kept charging me. And when I called about it, they said that they never received my cancellation notice."
721,1040242,2015-07-24,1,"I relocated to an area with no LA Fitness and attempted to cancel my membership in mid-June. The representative at the club told me I must speak with a specific individual, who only works Monday-Friday. Oddly, you cannot simply say 'please cancel my membership'. And unfortunately, I only get to the gym on weekends. The rep then suggested I call her during the week. After multiple failed attempts to call her and subsequent conversations on weekends when I was at the gym - still no progress in canceling my membership. Now I've moved, no club within 50 miles, and I call again to cancel. Finally, I'm told I can go online to execute a cancellation. Of course, now I had to create an account before accessing the cancellation form. To add to my frustration, I must print of a form and use snail mail to send it to LA Fitness' office and await a confirmation email from them that my membership has, in fact, been canceled. Based on all the hurdles to this point, I can only hope they actually receive the mailed form. I trust the USPS, but not LA Fitness. Based on this experience, I strongly discourage anyone from joining LA Fitness. Yes, my credit card continues to be automatically hit until the cancellation is finally accepted/processed. I've been trying to cancel over a month and now live over an hour from the closest club. Fed up..."

That is for personal training clients who pay a premium. She continued to tell me to leave, asked for my name, membership number, and telephone number. Of course she did not want to give me hers. Very unprofessional. Not a people person. I can't imagine she has a future in sales with her personality."

Now that I wanted to cancel the membership after 4 months then they are informing us that it was a years contract and we need to pay 1700$ to cancel the membership. This is LA fitness Bellevue WA. This is unethical business practice that they are following and contract is a key term that they should mention when a person is enrolling and specifically they hurry you up to fill the contract without having you read through them properly for the same case. Beware of these guys! Read the contract before you commit anything there."
724,1036694,2015-07-20,1,"The personal training manager talks a good show and sucks you in to buying personal training session at $50 per 25 minute session. He makes it sound like he's giving you a special, and then tells you that you can cancel within 14 days. What he doesn't tell you is that when you sign up, you are signing up for the entire year, and there's no way to get out of it unless you have a letter from the doctor. They will charge your credit card for however many sessions you signed up for, every month for the following year. BE SURE YOU READ EVERY LINE and READ YOUR EMAILS!"

They did not allow me to do that and also told me I have two options, both of which I cannot do. Either I go in and speak to a manager to cancel or send in a cancellation letter. The manager is hardly ever there and when he is I'm at work. Also, I do not have access to a printer. It'd be so much easier for the client to cancel over the phone - no confusion, it's instant, and general good customer service. I'm stuck with this membership!"
726,1034508,2015-07-17,1,"This is to confirm my immediate cancellation for my Pro Results Training Agreement. According to California Civil Code 1812.82(b)(3): ""The contract shall provide a description of the services, facilities, and hours of access to which the consumer is entitled. Any services, facilities, and hours of access that are not described in the contract shall be considered optional services, and these optional services shall be considered as separate contracts for the purposes of this title and Section 1812.83."" There were numerous occasions that I scheduled a personal training appointment with a personal trainer and they cancelled or rescheduled because no other clients signed up for the same day. Personal trainers stated, They prefer to stack sessions and will cancel if there are no other customers scheduled for the same day. Hence, the schedule for personal training sessions is not clearly defined or consistent and makes it difficult to schedule training sessions. Furthermore, the contract does not provide clearly stated hours of personal training access, violating California Civil Code 1812.82 (b)(3).According to California Civil Code 1812.92: ""Any contract for health studio services entered into in reliance upon any willful and false, fraudulent, or misleading information, representation, notice or advertisement of the seller shall be void and unenforceable."" The contract provides misleading information. The only information clearly written is for a monthly payment arrangement. There is no indication of a total cost so it appears the contract is for an initial fee of $99.00 with a $135.00 EFT/CC Payment per month for a 52 week period. When I requested to cancel the personal training service, several customer service members stated I was required to pay 50% of the remaining balance and proceeded to provide an amount. I was unaware that the personal training program had a total cost because the contract does not clearly state the total cost/balance associated with this agreement. The Pro Results representative mislead me to believe I was making a monthly investment for a 52 week commitment rather than purchasing an entire program and making monthly payments towards the cost of the program, violating California Civil Code 1812.92. For violation of the above California Civil Codes, this agreement is void and unenforceable. I request a refund within 10 days for the remaining portion of my payments. LA fitness has not adequately addressed my concerns and still maintains I am required to pay monthly."
727,1033369,2015-07-16,1,"I will be completely accurate and fair and hope that I'm not off base in feeling uncomfortable. Long story short, I'm a member of another gym (associated with a hospital, no contract necessary) but a friend was in town and working at LA Fitness. I had considered joining LA Fitness recently because of the many locations around Atlanta. I printed my guest pass, went inside, showed my pass to the lady at the desk who asked for verification of my identity - I provided her my Driver's License. MISTAKE. Rather than looking at my name, the name on the guest page, my age or anything, she briskly walked away, telling me to follow her, with my license in hand. Finally, she brought me to the row of desks where their salespeople sit. I asked for my ID back (at that point, I was already prepared for them to try to extract money out of me for trying to use a free guest pass) and she said that she couldn't give it to me yet, as the personal trainer (read: salesman) would need it for liability purposes. I met the PT and rather than ask about heart conditions, or health history, or anything pertaining to actually working out, he made me a series of offers including: (1) throw away the guest pass, no initiation fee but I had to sign a 6-month contract, (2) turn in the guest pass, use it for a personal training session of some kind, along with a 12-month contract. I informed him that I was meeting a friend and had come to check out the facilities in that location. I said I was happy to use the guest pass, and if impressed, I would probably join.If only I had recorded the rant this personal trainer/salesman went on next... He told me that by opting to use the FREE guest pass I was ""wasting money out of my own pocket,"" ""not committed to beating my own laziness"" and said ""you must not be pretty damn stupid if you want to throw money by not getting the initiation fee waived.""At that point, I had already been there for upwards of 20 minutes and he still had my driver's license in his hand. I stood up, informed him that I was going to either use the guest pass or leave and held my hand out for my license. Again, he refused and tried to turn the computer screen around to show me some different monthly options and I told him to leave me alone. He said ""Fine, go work out"" and put my license on the table. As I picked it up, he jerked the guest pass out of my hand (supposedly they're good for TWO FREE visits) and tore it up, throwing the shreds in the trashcan.I asked if I would need a new pass if I wanted to visit again and he told me ""don't bother coming back if you're not looking to commit to your fitness long-term."" I tolerated my workout with the friend who had talked me into this whole Guest Pass thing, and he informed me that the guy had given him the third degree as well for using a Guest Pass ADVERTISED ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE.I will NEVER go back to an LA Fitness and I encourage others to join me in saying no to the funky, borderline FALSE advertising associated with guest passes, high-pressure sales pitches (I wouldn't have actually sat down for one, but they were holding my driver's license at ransom for my time) and the ways in which these ""personal trainers"" at LA Fitness essentially bully customers into signing long-term contracts, regardless of intention. I do not appreciate being called ""damn stupid"" and I don't appreciate someone accusing me of being bad with money for not giving him/his company mine. NEVER AGAIN, LA Fitness."

730,1029913,2015-07-13,1,"I have been visiting the 441 N. Azusa Avenue West Covina, CA location for the past two months. I usually would go around 6-8 pm to jog upstairs and do some yoga in the class area. The last week I visited 06.28.15, a personal trainer named James asked me if he could interrupt my session while he trained his client. He did so again in the same session, I brought it to the front desk's staff and nothing was done. Next day, James stops me on the track to ask me how my workout is doing, I let him know I was in the middle of a work out and to excuse me. Twenty minutes later, he jumps from one of the hallways and grabs my hand and shakes it, I try to yank away and he pulls me closer to him. I told him to let me alone, and I did not want to speak to him. If that isn't sexual harassment, I don't know what is. As I begin to cool down he comes upstairs again, while I am in downward jog, and he begins to try to speak to me again. I ask him again, ""please leave me alone before I complain about you to your superiors"", he let me know he understands and walks away. Throughout the rest of my workout, he continues to follow me throughout the gym as I progress in my workout. I complained about him to Tina, the operations manager at that location. She was receptive and told me something would be done. The next few visits I had NOBODY at the front desk checked me in, I had to check myself in with the scanner, mind you there is always 2-4 staff members in the front desk. They all seemed bothered by me being there, and refused to say hello. In those same visits, nobody told me goodnight, nobody greeted, they just looked at me as if I was the thorn in their side by complaining about the sexual harassment I endured. I am VERY sure you will be able to pull up the images from your gym camera, to observe how I have been treated here after I complained, and you can clearly see I am checking myself in because none of your staff members wanted to pick up the scanner to scan me in. As I was gathering information about James to report to the authorities, I spoke with a staff member named Ruben. I asked him if he could please give me James last name, and he told me before he gives me his name, he needs to know why. I let him know about my complaint and asked Ruben to give me his last name as well, he replied, ""Oh I don't give out last names here,"" and hung up the phone. I feel so humiliated with my entire experience and am very depressed about not being able to work out even though I am spending my money on your company."

They sit behind a desk, make you sign on a pad and describe you something different than what they are stating. Promise to send you a contract via email which never comes and then you are stuck into the contract. They had a manager named Andrew who cheated a lot of members and split and now no one has the guts to do right by the consumer. They are all aware that this person made a mess and cheated the consumers but no responsibility is being taken. It is a third class organization with absolutely has no ethics. Shame on them. They have a lot of class action suits filed and now I can see why. Hope the courts make them pay for cheating the public."

Eventually, I figured everything out for myself and am ok with this club. However, if you are looking for customer service, I would not recommend it. They have several clubs I have worked out at. The club in Royal Oak, Michigan charges 44$ per month and has older machines than the Allen Park one. They call it a ""signature club"" probably for the Royal Oak address. The Allen Park and Livonia clubs are currently $29 per month. Price difference makes little sense as you can join at any one and go to all."

I recently made a call to an LA Fitness who I found out was employing someone who had committed acts of domestic violence, broken a restraining order, and raped the victim. When I informed the manager, his response was that he didn't want to get involved. REALLY? So be forewarned people. You don't know the personal trainers or even the managers of these places and many of them are criminals because this place hires them. I will NEVER be an LA Fitness member. And if anyone from LA Fitness is doing their job even remotely and cares about your brand or your image, you'll get out here and do some reputation management and damage control. Your corporate reputation is complete MUD. Clean it up, clean up your act, and maybe you can redeem yourselves."
736,1022487,2015-07-03,1,"I bought a year of personal training, used two sessions and was unable to go back to the club the remaining of the year. But the reason I bought it is because as long as you are a member, your sessions never expire. I called to ask about canceling but it was $1.000 or so, then I try to pay it off but it was the same so I kept paying to use it later when I'm able to get back to the gym. The year was complete, I called to make sure that was it and I told that I need to fill a form to stop charges. That form was going to be emailed to me, all need to do was to sent it to them by the 25th of the month. Well this was the 1st and until the 8th I keeping calling to get the form and they never send it to me. Then I ask for the manager and from thereon I guess my number was saved and the manager could never be reached. Then they said they talked to the manager and it was cancel, I should receive a email confirmation within 24 hours and never got it. So I called again and manager never available until I got someone else's cellphone and ta da, manager was in fact available. Talked to ** on the 24th and he guarantee that it was canceled and on the 2nd of the next month I was charged!!! My advice to you, find a club with no contract and pay a personal trainer yourself. One thing I found out it was that getting a personal trainer directly was cheaper if you shop well. LA Fitness has no integrity as company. Trying contacting headquarters and the complaints from customer about them are just as bad!!! I wish I read the reviews before sign up. They try on the last of my contract to buy my session for $130, I laughed, the last month cost me $134 so I said ""no I prefer to pay the last month and keep it now"". They are still charging my account even after canceling 2x."
737,1021824,2015-07-02,1,"They tell you that you can freeze your account, at no cost. That is incorrect and untrue. You still pay $10 a month. I signed up for a fee of $100 and the pay $24 a month. So that means I still payed 50% of my monthly fee when I froze my account. Then when I phoned to cancel my account, they told me I cannot do this over the phone, but need to come in. I travel frequently so now I have to wait till I am home to cancel this. 80-90% of their employees are in their early 20 (Eastlake Chula Vista) and their young men here definitely need better training. But I guess if the management is sleek and scheming in how they set up their business structure then that's how the rest will follow."
738,1021661,2015-07-02,1,"And you won't be able to because I have cancelled this membership. Despite speaking to at least 3 people you continue to call me daily and email me repeatedly. This membership is cancelled for the following reasons: I had a personal trainer. The Mississauga club decided to fire all part-time trainers. This meant my trainer was fired. I made 3 attempts to get a new trainer (weekdays at lunch anywhere from 12-2 PM) but none were available. The final time I was scheduled with someone and went into the club only to find out he had been double booked and was leaving for a couple of months the following week so didn't think it would be a good idea to take on new clients. I was charged for this session. I spoke to head office, the Mississauga club Manager both repeatedly about this issue. When I bought my personal training sessions I was told they would never expire but apparently they do expire and have expired - which was the sole reason I was maintaining this membership. My attempts (2) to transfer my membership to Milton were not successful. There is no convenient way to cancel this membership. I am told to go to my ""home"" club during normal business hours. Well this is impossible because my home club is in Mississauga and I live in Milton now and work downtown Toronto. I leave my house at 7 AM and get home at 7 PM. The alternative method is to download a form and mail it in, which I have done. Unfortunately it is to a PO box so I could not send it registered mail. I have resent this cancellation form a couple of days ago. Also, I was told to go online to get this cancellation form. Oops, it is only available if you have a user name and password. Since I had not been going to the gym I lost my key and did not have a membership number. I was able to call and get this. Strangely the form indicates that I will receive an email confirmation of my cancellation - I wonder if you can email me to confirm cancellation? Why I can't email the cancellation itself? I mean you've made it difficult enough. Oh and it is very convenient that when I make arrangements with people on the phone they cannot send me an email confirming our conversations since they apparently don't have email addresses? This is 2015. Everyone should have an email address who works for you and I bet they do. They are just told not to give it out. Now I am being phoned and emailed on a daily basis to update my payment information. Well guess what? I won't be doing this. Luckily for me I had a security issue with my credit card and I will not be giving you the number again. You really should reconsider your ridiculous policies. I can confidently say that I will never sign up for another LA Fitness again. However, had you not made this process so difficult I might have signed up again in the future. Add another lost customer to your ever growing list due to these ridiculous cancellation policies and inability to transfer locations. PS - It would be great if you could stop calling me EVERY SINGLE DAY."

740,1018786,2015-06-28,1,"This is the worst gym I have ever been a member of. The staff is unfriendly, the equipment is always being used as furniture for socializing, the lockers rooms aren't clean or well stocked, one bathroom stall was missing a door for weeks, more often than not there's no hot water in the showers, and above all, the cancellation process and fees are beyond ridiculous. There's a lot of pressure to join, and when you realize very quickly what a waste of money it is, it costs you a fortune and a lot of aggravation to cancel. The response from the staff when I requested cancellation of my personal training sessions was simply, ""You signed the contract. It was your responsibility to read the fine print, so there's nothing we can do"". At signing, the staff was very nonchalant, just pointing to places on the contract to initial. It was casually mentioned that training sessions typically run for a year. When they refused to cancel without charging me 50% of the remaining sessions, I finally got the Better Business Bureau involved. Then there were several calls to corporate, a promise from the member services director that my membership would be cancelled and not surprisingly, my checking account continued to be debited. And there's such a tremendous turnover in the staff, it's impossible to speak with the same person a month later. After 5 months of effort, I got an email telling me my buyout amount has been waived. I'm betting I'll be charged again next month. I have never done business with a more dishonest, underhanded, misleading, deceitful company. The way they practice business is atrocious and unacceptable. Do not join LA Fitness!!!"
741,1017407,2015-06-26,1,"I bring my teenage daughter into the club that I have been a member for the past 3 years. My daughter wanted to try the club out, she is off from school now for the summer. I ask a girl for a guest pass for my daughter, she says in a monotone customer-unfriendly way, ""that will be $20.00"" - reason being I did not set up an appointment with them for a guest pass. I wanted to speak to the manager. Another girl who was supposedly the manager gave me the same story, and then after I said I want to cancel my membership, she said, ""let me get you a sales consultant"". I said to her I don't need one, I wanted my daughter to try the gym - SHE WAS GOING TO JOIN! As a customer I felt so disgusted with the entire process, that I told her I wanted to cancel my membership. She didn't care one bit. I cancelled through the corporate office immediately after that experience. I made sure to call corporate because about a year ago my wife wanted to cancel. I informed the manager ** who promised to call me back with the cancellation info, and I was never called back, and was billed for the next two months. There are a number of gyms where I live in Queens, NY. I really recommend that you stand clear of the LA Fitness in New Hyde Park, it is not run well and it is not clean either. I will join another gym very soon."
742,1011015,2015-06-18,1,"The gym is understaffed. When I would work out in the evening, weights would be everywhere because no one puts them away. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR PERSONAL TRAINING!!! The personal training contract is separate from the gym contract and you CANNOT CANCEL even though you might move 50 miles away and have ZERO access to the gym you still have to pay your personal training fee. And corporate just says that since my contract was signed in Virginia they can't cancel. Are you KIDDING me? Just say it's your corporate policy. It has nothing to do with my state. You can't talk to anyone outside of their corporate call center. And **, the personal training manager, wouldn't call me back. My trainer quit and there was a period of two weeks where I COULD NOT get in for training because they didn't offer me one of the ""Master Trainers"" since I don't pay for that. For me, that means the terms of the contract changed. If I can't get into a trainer whenever I want, then they're not holding up their end of the bargain. They also said they'd call me when they have another trainer available. They never did. Meaning ** never called me back and the front desk person said the operations manager would call me back and he never did either. The place is a joke. And they only clean the facility once a day. My trainer when she still worked there told me that. It'd say it's unbelievable but it's not. I hear stories like this all the time about gyms. I'm just dumb to have believed it wouldn't happen to me."
743,1009651,2015-06-17,1,"It takes more than 3 weeks to fix a broken machine or equipment. Most machines have missing pins and staff says that's not their problem. They blame customers for stealing the pins. I've been a member for more than 2 years and it's very frustrating to workout at the Coral Gables location. The place is dirty, messy and the staff doesn't care much about the members. I've complained several times to the administration and their answer is always the same 'we are taking care of it'. It's a shame that a place where so many go to work out their frustrations happens to be the place where you end up more frustrated."
744,1004920,2015-06-11,1,Had a contract for training for a year but was unable to finish training sessions due to illness. LA Fitness told me I would not lose any sessions and would be able to finish them even after the contract was over. Now they changed their procedures and will not let me finish 28 sessions in a reasonable time. They only have 2 trainers which limit their choice.
745,1004606,2015-06-10,1,"1 month, 4 calls, 3 hours and 7 people spoken to about cancelling my trainer membership and still at square one. 2 times I've been told it has been cancelled and still no confirmation."
746,1004167,2015-06-10,3,"Here is my story: I enrolled with my local gym back in February of this year. A couple weeks later I went in for a free personal fitness assessment after receiving several calls from trainers at the gym. During that hour I was there, I worked with a trainer named **. After that long hour, in which I strained several muscles due to the fact he just jumped right into exercising, no warming up or stretching of any kind, leaving me exhausted from also being up since 5:00 am that morning, and ending the training session around 7:30 pm, your LA Fitness team member took me back over to his desk, where ** advised me I should add on the personal trainer plan to my gym account, as it would provide me with further help in learning how to properly use equipment, exercises etc. I asked about how long I would have to do keep it and about pricing. Your LA Fitness team member advised me of the cheapest plan which consisted of two training sessions a month for $90 each month, and that I would be able to change, remove, or cancel it at any time. I knew this would work perfectly since I didn't intend to keep it long and informed ** of my intention. I signed up, had part of the payment withdrawn from my account. ** proceed to hand me a pen, and pointed to me where to sign on the papers. Before I had the chance to ask he told me the documents were only to give LA Fitness permission to withdraw the additional payments from my account, and a liability waiver, that released LA Fitness from any fault if I were to be injured. I didn't have any chance to review, or even glance at the documents, as each time I signed/initialed one, he would quickly pull it away from me. Your LA Fitness team member also slid over an electronic signature pad, which he stated was only for the electronic signature for the same thing. Afterwards I didn't get documentation to take home. ** mentioned I would get a receipt and all documents that I signed by email. I did receive an email, however it just told me what I would be paying, the first bill date, and when I would be billed for the next. I split the first payment and down payment into two, paying $90 the first time. I was told I would have to come back in to make the second payment of $94.50. During the month of March I didn't use the personal training. In fact I was barely able to make it to the gym because of work. In the beginning of April I ran into financial trouble sooner than I thought regarding my car, and would need to invest in a new car. I was then charged on 04/13/2015 a total of $90.00 which I was unaware of, since I was out of town I decided to wait till I returned to call LA Fitness and solve this problem. However I was charged another fee of $94.50 right after, which was unexpected since I was told in order to make the second payment part of my sign up for the personal training I would need to do it in person. This was unexpected since I was told this could not be done any other way. I called LA Fitness to ask to cancel it, and for a refund of at least the most recent amount deducted. To my complete surprise a phone call I thought would be easy, left me in tears as the representative at a local LA Fitness told me I was locked in for a twelve month contract, and in order to cancel I would have to buy out the contract which would be a little over $500 and that LA Fitness could not help me. Now I needed to call the corporate number to speak about this problem. By discovering all this information I was lied to by the LA Fitness trainer in order for him to make a sale and get his commission. I felt betrayed. I also discovered that the LA Fitness trainer was no longer working with your company. The LA Fitness representative I spoke with during my first call was extremely rude and unprofessional. I tried to explain my issue and she continued to repeat as if she were a robot, ""you must pay $500"". I tried to request to speak with her supervisor which she blatantly denied. The LA Fitness rep then had the audacity to make a snide remark, suggesting she schedule me for a personal training session. The rep refused to listen to what I was saying and would not let me speak. I ended this call since I could see I was getting nowhere. I have worked in call centers before and having been a supervisor myself and knew this was not a way to conduct customer service. I called back shortly to speak with another LA Fitness rep. I explained my situation all over again. She began to tell me that I had to buy out the contract and I made it clear to her that it was not an option for me neither was paying $90 a month for what I then discovered were only two 30 minute training sessions. This new rep would not let me speak with her supervisor, but said she would talk to the department that handled personal training accounts to see if there was a way to resolve this problem. I heard back from her a few days later, she told me she spoke with the personal training manager located at my local LA Fitness, and that he stated that he trained his employees correctly and that the trainer that scammed me into a contract got a lot of sales. I told her that based on all my work experience as well as experience training people, that just because they are trained correctly, doesn't mean that they will follow all the rules. With no resolve to this call I advised her I would be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. The rep said she would contact a manager in another department and get back to me with a response by Monday of the next week since it was a Friday. I filed my complaint with the BBB, who said they would be forwarding the information to the company. Two weeks went by and I heard nothing at all from LA Fitness. I did receive confirmation from the BBB that my complaint was sent and received by LA Fitness. I called 05/05 at 4:55pm, and spoke with a man named **. He was shocked to hear that I did not receive a call of any kind, and said that I would need to speak with a department that handled issues escalated to BBB, and that since the lines were busy he would have them call me back within the day. Fast forward to 05/08, I still did not receive a call. I called at 4:47pm and spoke with **. She attempted to contact **, but was unsuccessful, and said she would forward my information to him so he could call me back within the day. Four days then went by and I heard nothing. This has been very stressful with the run around I have been getting. So I called again on 05/12 at 4:36 and spoke with **. He said he could not handle a BBB complaint and would forward information to a manager to have them call me within 24 hours. As I write this email today is 05/15, time is 8:35pm, and I have not received a call from anyone. The only thing I have gotten is an email briefly discussing the personal training contact. This issue which has been ongoing for one month has caused me such stress that it has begun to take a toll on me not only emotionally physically. The LA Fitness trainer who signed me up used my exhaustion against me, he never told me that I was signing a contract that I was locked into, or stated any terms or conditions of the package. If he did review the contract with me correctly I would have never signed up for this. He also attempted to sign my coworker up as well, telling her the exact same thing as I was told that it was an additional plan to go with the membership, and it could be canceled or changed at anytime. The tactics your LA Fitness employee used are appalling and after researching this issue with LA Fitness online, I have viewed thousand of customer complaints that stated similar issues to what I am experiencing. I've been told I signed the papers, which I never got the chance to read and was informed that was liability etc.Since the start I had been researching anything I could about contracts and what the fine print for contracts is, and then within minutes of receiving the BBB update I responded and refused their 'solution'. This is what I told them: Misrepresentation of material fact. Made knowingly by other party. With intent to defraud. Justifiably relied upon. Causing injury to the party in terms of monetary damages. These categories, which I fall under, are intentional misrepresentation or deceit to the other party (customer) which means there is no valid contract between the parties because of fraud. I know there is someone in this company that has the ability to void the contract, and refund me in full for all the payments totaling, $369.00. I have not used any of the personal training services. I want to resolve this with LA Fitness, however if necessary I will go to a lawyer to discuss further options. I cannot express the heavy toll this has taken on me emotionally and now physically to the point where I am sick. For a company as big and popular as LA Fitness to act like this when it is the customers who put the company where it is today is beyond me. If I was in anyway aware of the contract I would have not signed up, or I would have canceled during the cancellation period. However as stated this is contract fraud. To have trainers scam people to sign up for personal training sessions is unethical without properly explaining the terms and conditions. I truly hope this issue can be resolved in a timely manner as I would enjoy going to LA Fitness on my own.Today I received an email from LA Fitness confirming a cancellation of the personal trainer program, and that they would be issuing me a full refund. LA Fitness can cancel the program, contract are contracts, however if they fall under any of the reasons why it's contract fraud. On 06/09/2015 I received another email from them stating that the contract was canceled and all money paid, and unused, would be refunded to me. It is possible for them to void a personal training contract regardless of what they say, and if you were tricked into signing one like me then they need to void it."
747,1003123,2015-06-09,1,"I have been a member of LA Fitness for about 6 years. I recently moved to FL and transferred to Waterford Lakes LA Fitness. This is by far the busiest gym I have ever been to the 50 years I have been going to gyms. It is also the most disgusting, filthiest gym I have ever been to! I have been complaining for 10 months to no avail. You don't even want to go into the locker rooms because they reek so bad! The carpet should have been replaced YEARS ago! Forget about the showers!! Go home to shower. They are disgusting! Mold, flies, worms (seriously - worm in the showers), no soap regularly, no toilet paper regularly, no soap to wash hands regularly (I must admit, only 3 out of 10 even bother to wash their hands in the men's room!) Equipment - it is not uncommon for 10-12 of the treadmills to be out of commission at the same time, 3-4 of the stair steppers (out of only 7) out regularly, I can't speak of the bikes or elliptical as I do not use them. The classes are great! Instructors are courteous, knowledgeable, and energetic! Here is the catch, you have to buy and bring your own weights!!! I am a male and in great shape, I require 15 and 20 lb weights for the body works and boot camp classes. I am not ALLOWED to use any of the weights outside of the classroom! They have a weight rack with 2 1/2, 5, a couple 6 and 8s, and a few 10 lbs. I and several of the women have been told to never bring in any weights from outside the classroom. So, I have been told I have to bring my own! I am supposed to carry 4 dumbbells, 70 lbs total back and forth 4 times a week! How ridiculous!Speaking of weights, I can't tell you how many times I have gone to use some dumbbells and the entire lower rack is completely missing!!! All 5s, 10s, 15s, the one and only set of 20s, 25s, 30s, 35s, 40s, and 45s!!! Of course there are plenty of 80s, 100s etc. in the lower rack where the smaller weights are supposed to be! I blame that on the LAZY patrons, but it still need to be addressed by LA Fitness. Bags - there are signs ALL over the gym saying that gym bags are prohibited in the gym area. This is NOT enforced at all! You can regularly walk around and see 20-30 people with HUGE gym bags. I have tripped over them several times because they leave them out in the open! That is just the tip of the iceberg for the problems with Waterford Lakes LA Fitness. You would think with all the revenue that bring in, and it is a TON! They might put some money into the club! Clean it up! Upgrade some equipment! Buy some more weights! Get to work, Waterford Lakes!!!"
748,1001398,2015-06-06,1,"I enrolled in Feb. for using and hot bath tub, also for aqua fitness sessions. I am not physically fit to use other equipment that I had told manager at time of joining. Since I joined, after a month their pool and hot bath tub are irregularly down in every 15 days and is not able to repair it for continuous 2 months, and it has happened 3 times since I joined. So in 6 months I was able to use their pool for hardly 1 to 1 1/2 month. I regularly come for their aqua fitness at down times. They never intimate and I have to return back as I am not fit to use other equipment. They never give correct update when the pool and hot tub will get repaired. Their manager refused to reimburse my money and has recommended ""to join other fitness club that has pool."" I have progressed with my back pain as I was not able to use pool and hot bath tub and have lost mental peace with my time and investment."
749,1000426,2015-06-05,1,"I first joined LA Fitness in Tucson, AZ back on 04/16/2007. Paid my $150 membership sign up and $25 per month until I had my son in 2011 and then started paying $35 per month to allow him to come into the kids club when he became old enough. Never really had any problem with them other than noticed equipment was constantly out of order, drinking fountains weren't working, and the employees were overall rude with the exception of a few of them here and there. I basically went in, worked out, grabbed my son from the kids club and left. All the while they deducted the money out of my account every month without fail. Just yesterday while leaving the club my son went to get a drink of water with me following close behind, as he does every time we leave the club now. There is no water fountain in the kids club and he is thirsty when we leave, to be expected correct? This time a rude young girl from behind the counter came over to me and asked ""Is this your kid?"" I said yes, and she then said ""He is not allowed to get a drink out here on the floor, he needs to get a drink in the kids club"". That would be fine and dandy except for two things. There is no drinking fountain in the kids club, and I was right there with him supervising him as we do every time we leave so he can get a drink. I fired back at the young, immature girl, ""we are going to get a drink every time we come here, right here at this fountain."" She started talking more and being rude, so I get very rude back to her and asked for the manager. She told me ""There is no manager here"". I asked for her manager again, and said ""She doesn't have one"". Then one of her co-workers came over and pointed out the manager which I immediately confronted. Told him how rude they are and how I have been coming to the club since it opened (South Tucson location) and mentioned he better check his rude employees. We left and then today some corporate lady calls me from ** and tells me she heard about the episode yesterday and is going to cancel my membership. So I guess it is okay for their employees to be continually rude to members and their children, but when we are rude back they cancel our membership. I did not argue with her as I very much would rather give my business to some other gym. LA Fitness sure seems a lot like Bally's, and we know very well how they ended up. Out of business. Good riddance LA Fitness."
750,999288,2015-06-03,1,"We were members for over 3 years and signed up on the 30th day of the month. LA fitness then moved our payment date to the 28th, this is important! When it was time for us to move overseas, we asked about cancellation and were told 30 days. This is not the correct answer. You must cancel 36 days prior to your billing day to avoid any heartache. I spoke to every level of person until I arrived at the 949-255-7200 customer service number and they said that I signed the document and understood it and that they wanted the money. The fact that I paid with my credit card automatically every month was evidently proof that I understood that the 28th was the payment date etc. We did not use the service any day after we gave notice. This is not an honest business relationship and not American."
751,999125,2015-06-03,1,"Another example of corporation coming after your money when you tried to be a good customer. My wife cancelled her LA fitness membership in Sept 2014 since we moved from IL to CA. But after looking at our bank statement in May of 2015, we realized LA Fitness continued charging us every month. When we called them, as expected, they declined to take responsibility by saying cancellation cannot be done over the phone and blamed the associate that gave us the wrong information. When pressed, they agreed to refund 3 months of the charges but not the entire time since cancellation. We decided to file a claim through the back to recoup the remaining charges. I remember how LA Fitness's associate tried to sweet talk us into signing up for the gym membership by boosting about how great of a corporation they are. Guess all that only matters if you are an active member with them. Business ethics seems to an alien term for them. My advice, try to avoid LA Fitness at all cost if you can but if you no other choice, try to avoid signing up for the auto-billing system."
752,998500,2015-06-02,1,"Lies, lies, lies. Fraudulent business practices. I worked for this company, and it is the most unethical company there is. They will say anything to you to get a deal. Whether it be for membership sales, or personal training. They have zero ethics or morals. Do not work here! There are so many other gyms that are better and don't practice business like this. Also I quit with a very respectable and polite letter because I could not longer work for my boss who is the district VP of training in Atlanta. He never wished me best of luck moving forward, but rather left me a very threatening voicemail saying I could never use any other LA Fitness in the country. Every negative review you read about this company is true. I know because I worked there and have seen it first hand. Do not ever join here as a member, and whatever you do don't work here!"
753,995849,2015-05-30,1,"So I have been dealing with people from their corporate office for about 2 weeks now. I have talked to numerous ""managers"" (and I put managers in quotations because I don't think ANY of them are actually managers) and have had a horrible horrible experience with every single one of them. I cancelled my membership around the end of April and per my bank account, was charged $20.00 from LA Fitness on the 15th of May, which then resulted in a whole bunch of bank fees because I had insufficient funds at the time. I have dealt with numerous people from corporate telling me to go into a club location, contact an operations manager or keep calling corporate to get my money returned to me, and essentially getting the runaround. I called my home location one day and was told that the operations manager had left early for the day. I called the next day and was told the operations manager took the day off. I called in the next day after that and was told that that location had no operations manager at all, which was confirmed tonight (05/29/15). So I was fed a whole bunch of lies.... I talked to one gentleman from corporate this afternoon who told me that once he got off the phone with me, he would call my bank and get the refund started. Come to find out, when I went into my bank around 6:30 pm tonight, I talked to both of the branch managers who said the guy had never called them. Not only was I upset by learning this, but my bank managers know what I have been going through lately with LA Fitness and decided to get on the phone with corporate themselves. The one branch manager talked to a gentleman from corporate (not the same one as myself) and after being on the phone for a bit and describing my situation, he was told he was going to be placed on a brief hold and 20 seconds later, the call was disconnected by corporate. I was pretty outraged at this time, so I got on the phone once again with corporate and was very upset. I talked to yet another (different) guy who said he talked to the original guy (sorry don't mean to make it so confusing but I do not want to use names) and that he said that he DID call my bank but he was told that the manager that I told him to speak with was not in today.That is a complete and utter lie considering I was standing right in front of her when I went in this evening. I was then told I was going to be placed on a brief hold (after I told them that they were lying to me about my manager not being there) so that they could look into some things. I was on hold from about 7:20 pm Eastern Standard Time until 7:30 pm Eastern Standard Time and then the call was disconnected. When I tried to call them back, I got an automated message saying that their hours are until 4:30 pm Pacific Standard Time... OR! (get ready for it!), 7:30 pm Eastern Standard Time. So essentially I was put on hold until they closed for the night so I couldn't call back...Now I need to wait until they reopen on Monday (06/01/15) to TRY to talk to them again and hopefully not get hung up on this time. These people are all a bunch of liars and crooks! DO NOT deal with them at all! If I do not get anywhere with them on Monday I will be looking into taking legal action against them. STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM LA FITNESS!!"
754,994859,2015-05-28,1,"I'm contacting you in regards to 2 separate situations at the recently opened New Lenox facility. When I called to inquire about membership cost, I was told I had to come into the facility to get rates. Fair enough. I figured they wanted to get me in to give me the rates as well as a tour. I stopped by on my way home from work to get some information. My boyfriend and I were interested in joining and were looking at all options (other clubs and costs). When I stopped in, I was given the tour and the sales spiel. When I was given the rates, I said thank you and was going to have to discuss with my boyfriend so we could make a decision. This is where it got interesting.The manager berated me about having to check with my boyfriend. It's high pressure sales. I get it. However, I had mentioned the entire time that I was in only for info. He then proceeded to say things to me such as ""can't you make this decision on your own? You really have to check with your boyfriend? Who comes into a health club if they don't plan on joining at that time? No different than when you buy a car. I have a quota to make. I have a family to feed. I don't want to waste my time on someone who isn't going to buy.""Quite honestly I could care less about his quota and that he has a family to feed. I'm there for what I need and no I do not go into a dealership/health club and know that I'm going to buy that day. I do my research. And yes I can make decisions without my boyfriend/spouse/significant other. I choose to be respectful and have a conversation about it.I was appalled at what a jerk he was (and trust me, I'm holding back on how I really feel about him). I took the information and left. The issue is our local high schools offer free use of their pools for residents but due to recent funding cuts, the hours are now limited and I am unable to use which lead me to seeking membership rates. I need a pool due to my training. I feel like I have no choice as there are not any locations this close to me. If I didn't need a pool, based on how I was treated, I would never have given my $$ and joined this NL club and I actually wanted to go to the Tinley Park facility and make sure THEY got the revenue from my membership vs. the NL jerk but I was quoted a use 1 club only registration fee so again, felt I had no choice.So much that I mentioned to my friend about joining as well (she needs ONLY the pool as well due to an event we are participating in). She called yesterday and was treated poorly as well and that is why I decided to email you (and not right after I experienced what I did as mentioned above). She called to get rates and she was actually given rates over the phone. When the gentleman asked her for her phone number, she said she just wanted information and she didn't want to give her phone number. To which he replied, ""Well I gave you information so you should give me your information. No worries, I'll just get your number from the caller ID."" I used to work for a health club. I know how important sales and customer service to your customer is. I felt you should know about what is going on in your brand new club and how your new/prospective clients are being treated bc it’s pretty **."
755,994752,2015-05-28,2,"I am a new member to LA Fitness as of the first week of May along with my mom, husband and son. During the initial sign up my husband and I met with **, the manager at your Woodhaven gym. I set up an appointment at that time with ** for a fitness evaluation which was done on May 5th. After my evaluation, he went over the options to have a personal trainer. He used all the perfect applications and successfully sold me on signing a contract for a personal trainer one day a week. That day, he called the trainer that he would be connecting me with and set my first appointment with him that Saturday, May 9th at 12:30. His name is **. When I came in on that Saturday, and told the receptionist that I was there for my 12:30 appointment, she checked the computer and I was not listed as having an appointment with anyone. She said that ** was in fact in the building and she would call him and clarify the situation. As he walks up to the counter a few minutes later, he sees me standing there but does not acknowledge me or even make eye contact with me, instead he's drilling the receptionist with questions like ""Who set me up with this appointment?"" ""I didn't get any notification that I had anyone today,"" just one excuse after the other as he's clearly flustered. In the meantime, I'm standing there feeling like I've inconvenienced him. The proper thing to do was at least acknowledge me. I am a brand new client and I was completely ignored. This clearly was not a good start to this investment.I followed ** over to ** desk where the two of them were back and forth at each other about this situation. At this point I was beyond disappointed and I interrupted them both to tell them that I was going into the gym to exercise and when they figured it all out they could come and find me. Eventually, ** did come and find me and he did apologize but he did not work out with me that day. I asked if he could then just simply record my measurements and he at least agreed to do that. Our next meeting was the following Tuesday, then the Tuesday after that. I was please with his training and felt like things were going better until this week.We planned our usual Tuesday appointment for 1:00 pm this past Tuesday. Upon our initial meeting we exchanged phone numbers and agreed to text each other to communicate our meetings or any changes that may need to occur. I am an ICU RN at ** and due to my shift being cancelled on Monday, I needed to work a shift on Tuesday to make up for it. I sent a text to him approximately 11am on Tuesday, telling him that I would not be able to make my appointment and could we possible reschedule for Thursday (which is today) but he sent me a text at 1:40 pm telling me that he's not working at all at LA Fitness this week due to the fact that he let his certification expire and he needed time to study to get that completed.Now, as an RN, I understand keeping up on certifications, but when I don't keep up on my certifications, I'm not allowed to work at all. How is it that he's seeing clients but is not certified at this time? He mentioned also that LA Fitness isn't even paying him to see clients at this time but they keep booking him with people? I didn't show up as using a trainer in the system because apparently he wasn't technically supposed to be training? So, I'm being trained ""under the table."" Is that even legal?During the selling process, ** mentioned that LA Fitness has THE BEST trainer program in the state of Michigan. Clearly, due to the above information, I'm having a hard time believing that. I am sincerely regretting signing this contract and I am not convinced that this was a good choice on my part. I made a financial sacrifice to make this program a part of my life and I took it seriously. It's apparent to me that I'm just a number and within less than 30 days of being a member I'm considering going back to the YMCA from which we came. I realize the fine print says I only had 10 days to reconsider this decision for a trainer but considering these circumstances I am requesting to withdraw from this contract. If you have any further questions, you are welcome to call me. I'm looking forward to your response regarding this matter. Thank you."
756,994154,2015-05-28,1,"Today my husband and I went to workout at the gym and checked out 5-year old and three-month old into the kids club daycare. After about 25 minutes, I went to go check in on him. He was seated in an ExerSaucer (which he cannot be in that young because he can't support his own head) screaming and crying all while the LA Fitness kids club employee stay there and chatted with some guy at her desk. She didn't even know that they couldn't be in there that young - what the hell, isn't it their job to know? Thank God I went to check in on him or his neck could have had permanent neck damage."
757,993762,2015-05-27,1,My husband has been a member for years. A gym closer to our home offered crossfit along with regular gym membership and so he decided to join. We have been trying for 2 months to cancel the membership and have been to LA Fitness no less than 4 times trying to cancel. First they told us only the business operations manager can cancel but no matter what time we show up she is never there even though her hours are Monday thru Friday 9-5. 4 times at four different times a day and still excuses. I called and asked for the headquarters’ number which was never given to me. Instead someone claiming to be the manager continued to make excuses and tell me why only the business operations manager could cancel our membership and how I have to come in face to face for this. So I have decided to deauthorize payment from my credit card and mail in the membership card with a letter requesting my membership be canceled. We will see how that works.
758,992449,2015-05-25,1,"I cancelled my membership with LA Fitness and received a receipt for membership cancellation. When I received my credit card statement LA Fitness was still charging me. When I send them an email question the charges I received an email back from them stating to call my local gym. When I contacted the one I had been attended by phone, I was told that I had to come in person to cancel the personal trainer. If I cancel my membership to their gym, why would I still pay for their trainers. Once I cancelled my membership everything should have been closed out. Now am out $480.00."
759,992277,2015-05-25,1,I was a member of another gym for 20 years and LA fitness bought them out. My gym membership was about 120 per year as a benefit of being a 20 year member. They closed most of the gyms down and crammed everyone into a couple filthy gyms. No one ever picks up anything in the buildings. I stopped in this week because I have been busy and have not been to the gym to ask when my payment was due because they always emailed me. The last gym and LA fitness only corresponded with emails when you were due. The girl at the counter told me it was expired. I asked her how this could be when they never contacted me to tell me it was due. She looked up the account by my phone number and said they contacted me by phone and told me the number they called. I never heard of the number before and do not believe it was even a Florida number. My phone number has been the same for at least 10 years. She informed me that the mgr told her I would need to re-sign for full price. This was all a tactic to get full price from me as I’m sure we will all agree. I would never give this co a good review. I would rather give a new gym full price than ever do business with them again. Be careful customer service is a four letter word with LA fitness...
760,992027,2015-05-24,1,I am a college student that only needs a gym for 3 months while I am home. I spoke to the general manager and he told me that we could do a month to month contract and that I'd have no enrollment and $34 a month. I asked him how much I would pay for on the day I signed up and he told me I'd pay the initial 34 (I wasn't going to have a good paycheck due to just starting my summer job 3 days prior). After signing up I was charged 70 dollars saying I have to pay first and last month's fee. Had I known that I wouldn't have signed up for financial reasons. I was told that I had heard wrong and that he told me the cost before swiping my card which is untrue!! I'm upset now because they are blaming me telling me I wasn't listening when I know they didn't mention 70 dollars because I wouldn't have signed up. I am upset because I now have no money and they don't care that they all lied.
761,990190,2015-05-22,1,"So, like a lot of others I signed up for training, and was not told it would go on forever. However, my issue is even bigger. Because of travel for work, I paid for 45 sessions I did not use!! When I first talked to them about these (as I was cancelling the financial part) I was told I could use them whenever, they would last forever. However, now they have disappeared from my account, and when I talked the to gym tonight, I was told they ""expire"" a year after the account goes inactive. When I tell them my account has never been inactive, they tell me they mean the Personal training account!! So hundreds of dollars, gone. I intend to continue to fight them over this, but just as loudly tell anyone looking to use them to not deal with slime!!! "
762,988087,2015-05-19,1,The gym itself is not terrible however it is also not very forthcoming. I was told the day I signed up that there is no time limit on treadmills as I usually run for an hour. The next week when I came in I saw a sign for 20 minute time limit on cardio with people waiting. I built a home gym and kept forgetting to cancel my LA fitness membership. Called today and was told I need to come by for a form or get it online. Asked what fax I need to send it to and was told I have to mail it. The signup was a bunch of attempts to squeeze a few extra bucks out of me which I attributed to an overzealous commission based sales rep but this is ridiculous. You can sign up by walking in and promising to pay but it requires 10 steps to cancel and going to the location isn't sufficient! This type of business practice is what makes people distrust capitalism.
763,986777,2015-05-17,1,"I became a member of LA Fitness on February 9, 2015, with Membership Number **. I joined at and utilize the LA Fitness located at 19550 Restaurant Row, Houston Texas 77084, and telephone number (281) 578-0115. They made me sign the keypad I never had a chance to read the screen. They didn't explain its contents and told me that it was the contract. I asked for one month training, I started getting charges of $280.00 per month for trainers. I spoke to the Trainer Manager, Mr. **, email **. He told me that I signed a contract for 12 months for training sessions at a monthly rate of $280.00. He also remarked that it couldn't be cancelled. Later, I spoke to the location manager Mr. **, Cellular ** and office phone **. He told me that I have to pay for the training for one year. I explained to him that I signed the contract not being aware of its contents, and that if I wasn't able to resolve this with him, I would file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. He called me later and told me that he would cancel the contract for the training, but I wouldn't receive credit for the $280.00 that I had already been charged. I was very upset and started asking other members if they had similar dealings with the staff. Most of them told me that LA Fitness is well known for this type of transaction. Mr. ** then called me again and said that he will give a credit 9 training sessions. I agreed, otherwise I would lose the money I already paid. We reached that agreement on April 14, 2015, and he told me that I could start using the sessions 4 days later.On May 12, 2015 after taking a total of 2 sessions, I went to set up another appointment, but Mr. ** told me that the sessions had expired and he wasn't able to do anything else for me. You get good customer service when you first sign up, but after that, it goes downhill very quickly. I have never had this type of situation before, and I would like to get the balance of the training sessions refunded."
764,986661,2015-05-17,1,"My boyfriend and I joined LA Fitness in Royal Oak Michigan in November of 2013. Paid our monthly dues. Everything was going well as my boyfriend was assisting and working in with me. After reading most of these reviews I'm glad I never signed up with one of their trainers!! In spite of the fact that the staff was continually turning over, the equipment was out of order or in poor maintenance, we just did our thing. Yes I had stuff stolen but considered that my fault since they handed out free passes like candy and never mandated the guest be accompanied by a paying member. Last week we were confronted by yet another new staff member who claimed it appeared to him that my boyfriend was training me and threatened to revoke our membership. We spoke with the regional VP and thought everything was cook until yesterday I get a call telling me we are no longer welcome. Stating that it appears to them he is training me. After 20 months of paying my dues and attending that gym 4 days a week a new guy come in and based on his interpretation we are thrown out while they hand out free passes to thieves and persons with no intention of joining. Horrible disrespect!!!"
765,985491,2015-05-15,1,"I originally joined LA Fitness over a year ago because of the West Seattle location, that is still not open! At the Southcenter location, I was literally pushed off a piece of equipment, as the member mumbled, ""I was on this machine before you, so get off!"" The staff did very little to assist me, except, transfer me to the new Burien gym. At this gym, not only are people tripping over gym bags just left on the w/o floor, but several weeks ago on a Sunday, a gym member literally said, ""**-you, I see you sneaking in on my machine, I've been watching you and you literally steal every piece of equipment on the floor."" I told him to calm down, he told me, ""do you want me to stick that exercise bar up your ass?"" Again, I told someone at the front desk, but no one really did anything to remedy the problem. So now I'm concerned about another run in with this member. A new unnerving feeling that comes from a gym that should help alleviate stress, instead of creating it!!!!"
766,981680,2015-05-10,5,"I've been coming to LA Fitness for two years now. The central San Antonio location has made some major changes. The female maintenance woman in the mornings was horrible and looked like a slob, and the gym was suffering with the way it looked. The new cleaning staff is great. The new manager ** is super super nice and always looks great. I love going to LA Fitness again and I like the new staff. I recommended my gym to my friends and coworkers. I told my best friend that she was throwing away money at Lifetime Fitness, and don't even think about going to nasty Golds. My gym is awesome!"
767,978637,2015-05-05,1,"When I visited the gym and inquired about the facility and options they are very polite and accommodating to your request. Took me for tour and showed me all the facilities. Post the tour they wanted me to sign up and even I was interested to join since that is the reason to visit them. While giving me the break up their manager has told me that I can walk out anytime without any obligations and commitments and will get the prorate benefits, so I have decided to sign up and paid in advance for entire year because of some level of discount. Now with my job frequent travel and time issues am not able to use the gym and have hardly gone 2 times in a month. Have put a request to cancel my membership and now they are telling me that I cannot get my money back because it is an annual subscription and it has to be canceled within 3 days of signing which is a trap clause. They are also now debating with me that they have told me this information which was lie and trap. So they are literally fooling around with people emotions and trap them accordingly. I am still fighting to get my refund. Let's see how it works but my humble request to everyone is to avoid joining LA."
768,977976,2015-05-04,1,"When I signed up for personal training at LA Fitness, I thought I was signing up for 1 year. Then I see them continue to take money out of my account after the so called ""1 year contract"" has been fulfilled. When I finally find the contract and read it more carefully, I see the initial term acknowledgement which they only PARTIALLY go over with you. They go over the initial terms but skip the part that says automated billing will come out of your account until you send written notice to them! I'm sure they have made an enormous amount of money with this because unless you read the contract again at home you won't know they do this until the first ""additional"" payment comes out of your account! I think this is totally dishonest and do not wish to continue doing business with such a shady company!"
769,972200,2015-04-26,1,"I asked LA Fitness staff to change the TV station on the Seattle Mariners baseball game, and they refuse to do so. The excuse to employee stated and her name is **, was that she can get in trouble by her manager for changing the channel. She did not offer me any solution or when I ask to speak to a supervisor and manager she did not offer me any contact information. She said she didn't want to bother them. So my concern is, I pay for a membership, they have 11 TVs and not one station was on our home team the Seattle Mariners two nights in a row. We asked the staff to change the channel to a game. Both times the staff refused, all the sudden they can't find the remote. I'm very disappointed in the poor customer service, and the lack of training in this field for these employees, and that not once the solution was resolved. I even contacted the manager the following morning who said he would solve the issue and have that channel changed but when we came there the next day and the game was on it was never on the TV, and so we asked them to change it and they never did.Not only is the facility extremely dirty, the female locker room is never clean, and you have lazy employees just standing in the back texting on their phones or playing basketball without supervising the front counter. This is the worst establishment I have ever been with, where customers are not valued. you have 11 TVs, what is the point in even having them if you can't have anyone change it to the appropriate channel. But no it's okay to have channels with people shooting each other and killing each other more appropriate than sports channel. I'm very disappointed, poor customer service, dirty facility, and the employees don't even care about the customers. When you ask them to do something they roll their eyes and have the worst body language."
770,972041,2015-04-25,1,"I have been working out with a trainer at LA Fitness for almost a year. At one point, I coughed, and a front desk employee by the name of ** asked me if I was contagious. My trainer told her no, that I'm just sick. Afterwards, she made a rude comment, and said ""I could be ebola."" That is way out of line. I called and complained many times to management. They said they will have a talk with her and said she's wrong. But when I confronted her, she said, she never had a talk with management because she never made that comment to me. My trainer also denied hearing it. Therefore it's their word against mine, and they're covering up the harassment. It's unfortunate to have ignorant and rude people like ** work for a company like LA Fitness. She is the reason to why I am canceling my membership."
771,970688,2015-04-23,2,"I was a personal trainer at the Lynnwood, WA LA Fitness location for just one month. When I initially sat down for my interview, the personal training director, **, was enthusiastic, intelligent, and really knew his stuff when it comes to training. When I told him that client care and safety was my number one priority, he liked what he heard and brought me on board. At first I was excited. Then reality started to sink in. The district VP was hounding around looking to roll heads from the get-go. He would come in and gather the sales team and brow-beat them with his misguided sales philosophy, loudly spouting his nonsense (and obscenities) right in front of members and my clients. He also said derogatory things about overweight people. The sales team on a very good day doesn't get much done. When the VP was in the gym, productivity of the front desk and sales staff ground to an absolute halt. He also messed with my clients and outright lied to them about gratuitous sessions that the gym had no intention of providing--I provided the sessions whenever I felt they were warranted... and got in trouble for it. Then **, the dedicated, kind, and knowledgeable PTD, was somehow demoted and moved. The new guy they brought in, a 26-yr-old former college basketball standout from Senegal, was out to prove himself and immediately began dismantling all the good things ** had established. All client trust evaporated. The new PTD was uncertified, and he would put prospective clients through very unsafe workouts. I found out that the VP tells his PTDs to put prospective PT clients through brutal workouts so that they will think they are more out of shape than they are and somehow feel more compelled to buy training than they otherwise would. He also told sales staff and a client of mine that clients should be weighed every session, which is an absolute crock if ever I heard one. I was continually amazed at how the clients were treated, and when I tried to show compassion and understanding for their concerns I was ultimately hamstrung by the unethical and wholly uncaring business philosophy of the company. Finally, last week, I was out sick for a few days (bedridden and vomiting) and had taken the care to contact my clients and let them know what was going on. I had tried to inform the new PTD but he was always ""busy"" and either didn't return my calls or just didn't seem to care. I returned to work and found out that my sessions for the day had been cancelled. One of the other trainers told me that all was well and that I should head home and rest for the day. I did. I checked the employee portal later that evening and saw that someone was systematically removing my clients from my schedule. Again, no one had contacted me about anything. I drove up to the location later that evening and confronted the new PTD. He hemmed and hawed and really didn't seem to have focus. I told him that the previous PTD had informed me that I was to act as though I am my own business, and any emergencies or illness was to be discussed directly with the clients. He looked at me, his ego swelled, and he said, ""But you have to tell ME!"" I finally had had enough. I asked him point blank, ""Am I fired or not?"" He didn't say anything. Simply nodded. So I stood, shook his hand, thanked him for the opportunity, and left. I have been contacting my clients letting them know what is going on. Many of them are canceling their PT contracts because of the way I was treated. The support from them has been fantastic, but I really feel for them--they are being robbed and lied to. LA Fitness is a truly corrupt, misguided, and unethical company and I'm relieved to not work there anymore. I know this is the consumer affairs website and I was an employee, but I am telling everyone who reads this to stay away from LA Fitness. The inexpensive gym membership is enticing, but DO NOT fall for it. The company does not care about you. There are other gyms that do."
772,968232,2015-04-20,1,"When I took a tour of the new LA Fitness center on 4412 North Shepherd, Houston, TX, I liked what I saw. The facility was very clean and the trainer that gave me a tour was very friendly. She told me about the program where a fitness trainer will show you the right way to do the exercises and the proper way of using the equipment. She said that when you join you can cancel the trainer program whenever you like. Just tell them that you just want to use what you were trained on and when you wanted to start out again let them know. After three months I was really not getting much out of the training program so I decided I wanted to quit and not throw my money away on something I really wasn't getting much out of. I just wanted to use the equipment that I thought were benefiting me. After the three months I talked to one of the employees of LA Fitness at the front that I wanted to quit the fitness trainer program and was told that I could not quit and that I signed a contract until 12 months were up. I then asked him I would like to talk to a manager and he said he was a manager. I told him the reason I signed up was because I was told that I could quit whenever I wanted and I was just suppose to let them know. They do the same tricks in sales that car sales and insurance sales people use to get people to sign on the bottom line no matter what it takes. I think any business that has to use those kinds of tactics to get people of sign up for their programs has a sales force that is not very ethical to say the least. Professional and good sales people do not have to lie to get a sale. You will not last as a sales person if you need to lie. ALL I CAN SAY IS LA FITNESS IS NOT A VERY ETHICAL RUN BUSINESS, SO BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE SIGN UP FOR THE TRAINER PROGRAM!!! IT'S A SCAM!"
773,965147,2015-04-15,1,"We went to the New Lenox club when it just opened and sat down with their sales rep. We disclosed that our son was 13 and wanted to be able to swim there in the off-season. The LA Fitness rep says that would be no problem, and that he could lift weights as well. The next day when we tried to use the facilities, they said he could not, as you had to be at least 14. This was the main reason we joined. Not only were we lied to, they are making it very hard to get out of the membership now - despite the fact that we joined one day ago. So this center is off to a very bad start. I would be very wary of this place. LifeTime Fitness is a better choice if you're in the SW Suburbs of Chicago. LA Fitness has a poor selection of trainers at this point too - and group fitness opportunities are scarce."
774,963950,2015-04-13,3,I had sign up for personal trainer. It was going good till she left. So I didn't want to train with no one else. So I try to cancel my contract but couldn't. So now I'm paying 160 a month and I'm not using their trainer. Once my last payment is up I'm going to 24 hours gym.
775,963455,2015-04-13,2,"When I signed up for personal training I said over and over I would only agree to a 6 month contract. They told me ok, but later found out it automatically continued taking $540 a month out of my debit anyways. I fought with them getting it stopped after 2 more months of withdrawals. That's an extra $1,080. I found out they trick everyone by not telling them they put that in the contract anyways even if you say no. The law system in America says if any company tricks you like that, it is ok because everyone in America should be a lawyer or have a lawyer look at everything you sign. If you trust the company is telling you the truth what is in a contract, you are the sucker. ""NO PROTECTION FROM THE LAW"". LA Fitness takes advantage of that crooked trick to steal from people. BEWARE, the law will ""not"" help or protect you. They will only protect the thieves. We find American law protects the companies and the rich, ""not"" the people. "
776,961735,2015-04-10,1,"Let me preface with this. Their gym and equipment are pretty good. Not excellent, but I definitely don't have any major complaints. My real complaint is well known from LA Fitness, their corporate level policies, recruitment gimmicks, seemingly mentally ** employees and instructors are and their downright scams and trickery regarding cancellation and hidden fees. My (ex) girlfriend and I had a membership and eventually wanted to cancel it for a cheaper alternative. I followed the instructions to cancel my membership and it was never done. After going in person to cancel it, during the time frame I was told to come, the magical person who can click a button to cancel my subscription wasn't in. Oh, and he wasn't in the next day either. At that point, I said screw it. I was moving my funds to another bank account anyway, so any further charges would decline. Literally the day after my membership would have been charges, I received no less than 5 calls. They left voicemails, all ditzy sounding young girls (even their hiring practice is corrupt, go figure). These calls, even though I block each number (over 50 now), have continued for 2 months now. Funny how good they are at collections but you have to talk to a nonexistent individual or send them a cancellation letter, which they conveniently never receive. Yeah right. Bottom line, the gym is pretty good. Just try not to talk to their employees if you enjoy having brain cells. And if you sign up, use a throw away card or something so you can cancel your own membership, because they sure won't."
777,960948,2015-04-09,1,"I joined LA Fitness in January 2015 and signed up for a trainer with the understanding that I could cancel at any time with 30 day notice. I mentioned that I was an organ donor and would miss multiple months starting in February 9, 2015 because of organ donation. I was told that the trainer services would be suspended and I would not have to pay the $180 during this period of time. Much to my shock, I was billed for February 2015 and double billed in March 2015. I am AMAZED at the LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM because when I called to resolve the issue the representatives hung up on me. I expected a more professional response and understanding when I tried to do good for someone else, Only to find that LA Fitness is just concerned about money. Why does LA Fitness represent good health for people while harming people emotionally, physically by their reaction to inquiries and financially."
778,960115,2015-04-07,1,"I had been going to this gym and had a Master Trainer for about 2 years. I was very fit. After going away for vacation for 2 weeks, I got back and found my trainer gave away my standard days/times for our sessions. I went from 3 sessions a week, to 1. I began losing my strength and complained that I could hardly get a session. He recommended a boot camp class in the meantime. When about to pick up a weight for one of the exercises that required a twisting of the hips while bending down with the weight, he told me to get a heavier weight. During that exercise, I ended up tearing a ligament in my lower back. An MRI later and thousands of dollars in chiropractor visits, I then requested a refund for the 35 or so sessions that I paid for in advance due to my injury. For nothing would they give me a refund, nor would they transfer the sessions to my son. THEY ARE COLD-HEARTED JERKS THAT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR KEEPING PEOPLE'S MONEY!!! I transferred to another location and found that they sell Master Trainer sessions yet have no one available in the early evening hours for people that work 9-5. They sell it and then don't care if they can fulfill their contract!"
779,959904,2015-04-07,1,"La Fitness, I believe it would be of your best interest to know of the interaction that I, one of your long term members (from several other accounts) have had. I am currently a member of an LA Fitness in San Antonio, TX and I am incredibly disappointed with the lack of respect and professionalism of the LA Fitness manager that I dealt with today. **, the current manager of the LA Fitness off of 410 and Blanco in San Antonio was completely inappropriate with his actions and words toward me today and I am incredibly offended. I previously held this company with very high respect but the lack of respect of this manager that LA Fitness has hired and termed a ""good fit"" for this company is incredibly upsetting and I am on the verge of quitting my membership there altogether. The way I was treated today was absolutely absurd and I'd hope that an appropriate action be taken to compensate for the abominable interaction that I had today. Today, April 7, 2015 at 11:00 am, upon waiting to cancel my personal training package due to monetary issues, **, the manager of my LA Fitness, approached me immediately rolling his eyes with a very smudge attitude and asking why I was quote ""wasting his time"". He then proceeded to ask how old I was and told me that I was being childish for canceling my personal training. I have never felt this disrespected in my life! His rudeness continued throughout the entirety of the cancellation exchange as I continued to bite my tongue while he continuously threw insult after insult at me. Finally, after the 5 minute ordeal, I asked to have the corporate phone number and he refused to give it to me, telling me that it’s ""in my contract, if you still have it"". After realizing I wasn't getting the corporate phone number, I finally decided to leave the facility. In utter disgust.Now I ask you LA Fitness, is this how you train your managers to speak to loyal members of LA Fitness? I do not know this manager personally and have only interacted with him once at LA fitness (not to mention, during the first interaction with him, he was also acting inappropriately by advertising his local strip club to me). Every encounter with this manager has left me offended! I truly hope that LA Fitness does not consider this appropriate behavior. The fitness place that I looked forward to going to has completely turned me off and I don't think I'll want to continue my membership in a facility with such horrible management. I decided to keep my membership and just cancel the personal training package but the thought of the blunt rudeness of ** has completely put me off of this company and it is truly sickening that you would hire a manager of such distaste.I come to LA Fitness to enjoy my time and have a good workout, but I will forever remember the blatant rudeness of the employee you deem fit to manage an LA Fitness. I have never issued a customer service complaint with any company, but Customer service this horrible needs to be fixed. I will not continue support a company that believes this action was satisfactory."
780,959467,2015-04-07,1,I was fortunate to enroll via Humana's Silver Sneakers program. However the 'Personal Trainer' spent at least half the session trying to sell me on a regular personal trainer program even though I told him from the outset that I couldn't afford it. In the end he got it down to $166 per month and I would have to sign a contract to have it automatically debited from my bank account monthly for the duration of the contract. He fumbled through the bicycle and rowing equipment without explaining how to adjust. Today I went to Anytime Fitness at Metro West and got a very thorough and comprehensive session. This is where I will be going.
781,958219,2015-04-04,1,"Just over a year ago, LA fitness hired me as a PTA, which works under a PTD. Right out of the gates, I was kicking butt booking appts. and establishing relationships. I was outperforming the PTD, and so after 3 or 4 days he pulls me aside and fires me. He tells me LA Fitness doesn't like my style. It hurt me, but I kept on trucking forward. I didn't let that affect my workouts, so I continued to workout there 5 days a week. Well, after another local LA fitness closed, all the overflow came to my gym. It was so packed for 9 days I felt like it wasn't fair for me to pay. The manager told me to ""** deal with it!"" I cursed him out and than hung up the phone. The manager calls me back and starts reading off my address, name, etc. I felt threatened so I went down to the LA fitness to confront this guy. Now, the district manager, **, calls me and says I was in the wrong and no longer can come back to any LA fitness. Don't ever try to work for them. They will replace you within weeks or months. Just pay attention to the front staff. How often are the faces changing? Way too often! Only maybe one or two faces will actually stay hired. LA Fitness is run by corporate fools who don't know nothing about fitness and training. The PTAs and PTD require no certifications to train you! That's bad, that means your first workout with them can hurt you or injure you. They follow a script. Why? Because none of them last more than a few months. Just watch and pay attention."
782,955033,2015-03-30,1,"Hi, I am a member of your club at Eglinton and Warden avenue in Scarborough. I find the facilities very dirty and unattended, the showers smell of stale water and the drains are stained with brown water, left there for weeks. The showers have dirt and band aids left there for days and weeks. I don't understand how a company that has so many clubs and staff neglect their clubs in such a manner. It is disgusting to take a shower and walk bare foot in the change rooms. I also have a complaint about the training staff, on the PA system you advertise that if you are not sure how to use a piece of equipment to ask the trainers, well I have done so twice to be given a very rude and unhelpful answer. I am shocked by your class of clubs and by the way you keep them. I am sure the health department would like to hear about this. I unfortunately just signed up a few months ago and I am very disappointed with the standard you keep. If I don't see a change in the cleanliness within a short period of time, I will have no choice but to send a letter to the health department with pictures for them to look after this issue."
783,953829,2015-03-28,1,"LA Fitness Ocoee - Always dirty, seems there is no cleaning staff at all in this gym. The teachers sweep the floor before class but there is crap all over the floors from months of no mopping! Makes yoga class really gross when your face is near all that gunk. The bathrooms have been extraordinarily dirty lately, does any staff ever check the women's room? Even the black mat going into the wet area is full of nasty debris, hair, dirt and who knows what! Looks like this gym might be one they are closing down?"
784,952106,2015-03-25,1,"Two of LA Fitness employees (**) deceitfully signed me up for 1 year Personal Training contract instead of 1 month of Personal Training sessions as I requested. On January 25th I came to LA Fitness (4850 Little Rd., Arlington, TX 76017) with my parents to sign up my mother for 1 month of personal training sessions twice a week (I paid). ** gave me an electronic pad to sign and when I leaned forward to look at their monitor to see what I'm signing, ** said that this is just a standard procedure, a waiver releasing LA Fitness of liability in case I get hurt. There was no mentioning of CONTRACT in our conversation at all! My parents and I made it pretty clear that we are looking for 1 month of personal training sessions only. As soon as I noticed the second charge on my credit card it was already too late to cancel the training sessions without paying 50% early termination fee about $1500! I contacted ** as soon as I saw the recurring charge on my credit card and asked them to fix it. I even agreed to sign up for a 1 year contract with a lesser number of weekly sessions. However, after about 2 weeks of delaying the response, with a glimpse of smile that ** couldn't hide, I got the final answer that there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING they can do. They even tried to convince me that signing up for a year was exactly what we discussed. ** kept saying, ""Don't worry, we'll take care of you."" Boy he was right! They did indeed taken care of me!If I can’t legally prove their fraudulent actions, at least I will make sure that all of my friends and everyone else who reads this review is aware of LA Fitness unethical and fraudulent business conduct practices. Lessons learned: never sign an electronic pad (signature can be copied/pasted) onto another document. Always request a hard copy of the signing document. Read it! Then you can sign it. If you were convinced that they do care about you re-think it! It’s a business for them! And they’ll do everything they possibly can to take your money! Honor, decency, morality all long gone. Trust - has been pretty expensive currency lately. Pros: on a grand scheme of things, $3000 is not a big price to pay for such important lessons."
785,951253,2015-03-24,1,"I went into my club in January to cancel my membership. I was TOLD the only way to cancel was to download a form and mail it in. I did that, in march while checking my credit card statement i noticed that LA fitness had been charging me for 2 months? I called and was told by a supervisor that they never received my letter, and that I could have cancelled right at the club? He said he would cancel my membership, but would not refund my money?"
786,951248,2015-03-24,1,"I just had a baby and decided I would join the gym that was near my work, more convenient to work out before work. I chose LA Fitness as it was less than 5 minutes from my office. As soon as I walked in I was sat down and told if I wanted results I needed to get going and join today. They would waive their regular fees as a part of a special (which they did NOT as I checked my CC statement about a week later and I paid well over $300 as a ""fee"" to join). I was then told I needed to add additional costs to the regular membership to have access to the club near my house and they said it was a difference of just a ""few dollars"". Checked my CC statement again and apparently a few dollars is $25.00 to them. I was FURIOUS. Then I was told I got a free assessment with a personal trainer and I needed to book that now... So of course I did for the next day where I was quickly ""assessed"" and told I was extremely out of shape and needed to hire the trainer or I would not be getting the results I wanted... He told me they would once again waive their fees (which ONCE AGAIN THEY DID NOT... They actually charged me about $540.00 this time!!!) then it would only be about 80 extra each month and I needed to pick how many training sessions I wanted. I said I wanted to do the 6 month program and he assured me I was not going to get results and I was wasting his and my time, that I needed to do the 1 year term so I agreed, at $80 a month it didn't seem that bad... NO...After looking at my contract while trying to cancel it was $440 a month and about $80 a SESSION!! I WAS FLOORED. I have been trying to speak with someone about this for weeks now as I've been trying to cancel and have been given the runaround! I want my training AND gym membership cancelled ASAP and I WANT MY MONEY BACK!! I feel completely taken advantage of and scammed. So disappointed as I was very excited to start a new chapter of healthy living in my life!! Highly, HIGHLY dissatisfied with this ""business""."
787,950376,2015-03-23,1,"I signed up on 2/20/15 and I'm not setting foot into any LA Fitness ever again. I've experience the worst customer service ever and the staff are grimy and crooks. I understand that they're running a business, but they're screwing people over on a daily basis. Long story short, I signed a personal training contract after making myself clear that I only wanted the three month program, but I come to find out that the lady signed me up for 12. I didn't read the contract because I figured that she knew exactly what I wanted. I confronted her about the issue and she completely denied it. They work off of commission so she shafted me so she can get more money. I know this is true because I talked to my trainer about the issue and he told me that he wasn't surprised and that it wasn't the first time that she's done this. I've made some arrangements and LA Fitness cannot process any payments with the billing information that they have on file. Haha! So if you decide to sign up for personal training, make sure you read the contract before you sign it! That's the best advice I can give."
788,948313,2015-03-19,1,"We will not renew our membership at this club. We have been members about 5 years, and it has gone downhill since then. My husband's locker was broken into twice, and no one seems to care. They do not fix equipment on a timely basis, and the bathrooms and locker rooms are disgusting. Very high turnover rate with staff."
789,948168,2015-03-19,1,"When I signed up for the gym I was new to the area and as it was the holidays they had specials for new sign ups. I did ask about personal training and was concerned about the contract for training as it said it was set for 12 months. After speaking to the manager, ** , and TWO other sales associates they ALL confirmed it was just to lock in the price for a year but could cancel my membership and my training at any time.... It was just to get a cheaper discount. Well, 5 months later and this location not being able to keep ANY trainer and trainers not showing up, and excuse after excuse and just pure laziness and incompetence by ** the new manager I was already upset. Last Thursday, 3/12 ** was doing more excusing of why he can't run a gym and tells me that the previous Manager was lying to all new members about the contract and 100's of people were furious so he was cleaning that mess up. I was devastated and told him “I was told the exact same thing!!” I came in today... saying “this was unfair and I wanted to cancel” that I was tricked into This... He told me he would not do it, tough ** and not to come to his desk. I am waiting on corporate to open so I can call. This is a horrible and shady business. I am not a money cow and it's exactly how they treat you! Awful! I am attaching my membership cancellation receipt."
790,947796,2015-03-18,1,"I have been a member in the Jensen Beach LA Fitness for less than a year. Blue Cross offered me access to thousands of gym for a flat rate. I could go to any of the gyms on any day, and a different gym every day if I like. I signed up, and then tried to cancel my LA Fitness account, but that is not possible. You have to cancel when a manager is on duty, so you must go during your work day. Then once you do get to cancel, they keep your last month fee, as they said it is not refundable. So I am double billed for health care this month, and it makes no to them. Now the gym is somewhat clean, and that is the best I can say. The machines break and while some take a long while to get fixed, some never get fixed. What does not get fixed are tread mills, either the electronics on them is failing, or the TV that is attached does not work. They stay that way year in and year out. I have never seen one get fixed. When it is busy, I know I can get one to work by simply opening the hidden floor panel and unplugging the power, and plugging it back it to get it to reset. That usually gets it going for me, and since I am one of the only customers that knows to do that, I do get to use a tread mill when it is busy. They are always trying to get you to hire a trainer, but I am self trained, and do not want to be bothered by them. Don' forget, if you intend to quit going to LA Fitness, they want a month's notice. They do not refund any money, ever, no matter what.The biggest problem is that they want a premium price to join, but don't offer premium service. Last year they would not take Silver Sneakers type members, but this year they do, and they also say that they don't know how long they will. So it is clear to me that membership is down, and they are hard up for new members. If that ever changes, they will start refusing people who are using other services to gain access to the gym."
791,947195,2015-03-17,2,"So, on July 2, 2013 I take out a membership-- paid $149.00 initiation and $44.95 a month which is only $5.00 more for racquetball and towels service of which I use neither and this club has no towel service."
792,946969,2015-03-17,1,"I joined L A Fitness last September. From day one they were incompetent. They spelled my email address wrong. When I told them the manager replied, ""We can't really fix that. This problem can only be fixed by our corporate office in California."" Long story short, they never fixed it. I made the mistake of signing a personal training contract for one year. The fee was 90 dollars a hen. I was to receive 2 half hour sessions a month and 7 ""free"" sessions. My trainer was great. Unfortunately, after six months His boss **, promoted him and made him a ""Master Trainer."" The bad news was if I wanted to remain with my original trainer, I had to pay another 7 dollars per workout or I couldn't workout with him. I never knew when I was going to be billed or how many sessions I even had each month. I opted to buy out my contract because I thought I shouldn't have to pay for my trainer's promotion. Why couldn't LA Fitness pay it? When I tried to buy out my contract I was fraudulently charged an extra 225 dollars. I had to spend hours on the phone with their corporate office and told to go to my bank and ask them to talk to them. They kept maintaining that the charge had never been completed. The Lady at my bank tried to talk to them and help me but the girl ** kept interrupting her and refused to back out the charge. I was told I had to wait 24 to 48 hours and then I would be refunded the money. I asked LA Fitness and ** to send me an email to verify this information was correct. She refused. I was told I had to go to the L A Fitness in St. Petersburg Florida to the 22nd Ave location and ask them to print out that I wouldn't be billed. I didn't want to go back to that Gym. I talked to their company at length and I never was really explained the reason why I was double billed, but that it was a glitch in the system. I also told then that I was hacked on my debit card a day after my previous charged from them. In short, L A Fitness is incompetent and they only really care about the money they make off of their members. Whatever you do, Do not sign a personal training contract with them. The best thing about my experience with them was my personal trainer, who was awesome. But they got greedy and gave me an ultimatum: either pay for his raise or lose him as my trainer. That's the way L A Fitness does business."
793,946175,2015-03-16,1,"DO NOT BUY INTO THE PRO RESULT PROGRAM! Your training sessions allotted to you EXPIRE and no one contacts you about when the expiration draws near and you will receive NO alert about it. I was not able to use my sessions before expiration because LA Fitness has A HUGE TURNOVER RATE when it comes to their trainers and I have gone through 5-7 different trainers throughout the program. This means I had to go through a week or longer with no trainer before I could set up with a new one which means I would have to go through double the need for a trainer within a week just to utilize the sessions so they would not be lost. The thing is, I was subscribed for 2 sessions a week. How is it MY fault that I could not use the trainers when their trainers were quitting or being fired so often? Now my sessions have expired and I can't redeem them when it was no fault of my own? I had 13 sessions left to use and no one ever got to me on renewing and continuing for the program so I never even realized the expiration was near. I HAVE ALWAYS expressed concern about the high turnover rate with trying to raise awareness to the issue with the club management and trying to contact someone at corporate with little care by the club manager/training program manager. I have a history of e-mails that have gone unanswered to LA Fitness on the subject. I have been going through great distress over the whole program and at the cause of my own health feel little motivation to continue with my lifestyle at the gym after feeling soo cheated and ignored by LA Fitness. I don't want to bother anymore because of them. I was able to finally get a call from the VP at LA Fitness for an extension on the use of the sessions but only by about 30 days. The problem to that is, MY ACCOUNT STILL HAS NO SESSIONS ACCREDITED TO IT! So how can I make these appointments that are time sensitive for the use of my sessions if my profile is still not accredited for these sessions for me to make online? I am trying to contact them but they respond SO SLOW and I am only having days wasted when I could be setting up appointments to use my training sessions. They WILL NOT RESPOND in a timely manner. I've grown depressed because I feel so cheated out of an EXPENSIVE program and all the money I will be losing. This was supposed to be a gift to myself to celebrate a life event I had accomplished. Now it's a lesson to never trust LA Fitness Customer service."

795,942687,2015-03-11,1,Purchased a membership for my son who used LA Fitness for a couple of years. The membership fee was auto debit from my credit card account. When my son moved I called to cancel and was told I would have to go in to cancel or go on line. I went on line and the process was so long and required so much information that I was not comfortable with. I went into the facility to cancel and asked several times while there if it was cancelled and also reiterated not to charge my card. The girls behind the desk assured me that it was cancelled. I get my credit card statement and there was a charge from LA Fitness! I called and was told that I was to send in an application given to me by the front desk where I had cancelled. No such paperwork was given to me. I demanded a refund for the charge after cancellation and the girl basically said I did not send the paperwork in. This is the first time I have ever written a review. Bad Bad Bad business practice! Sign up and never get out without a lot of hassle!!! LA Fitness is a negative 10 star for me.
796,942377,2015-03-10,2,"Every time I go to the locker room it is grossly dirty. They hired a girl to clean and she mops with dirty water and spreads germs all over. The lockers are never cleaned out, etc... There has been trash in the Sauna for months. No one ever cleans in there and people go into the Sauna with shoes. This make no sense to me. Again, every time I go into the pool the floor is dirty. The pool has junk in it and looks like it has not been cleaned for days and has an odor. Workers do not promote the LA Fitness rules to make sure people are wiping down machines. The front desk workers are not friendly at all except for two of them. One of your managers is extremely unfriendly. There is a custodian and he tries to intimidate your customers. One day I was leaving the women's locker room and he had a bunch of light bulbs right by the entrance. I almost fell and had to jump over them and hurt my back. He just stood there daring me to say something."

My kids always play basketball and they don't use any equipments. I pay for my kids too but they can't use the gym! Very unprofessional manager LA fitness hire. I don't know what criteria they look before they hire. I will tell all my family and friends not to sign up and cancel their membership just because of this manager at Leesburg. I gave zero star out of five to this location."
798,939631,2015-03-06,1,I get charge twice the same day. I get the wrong information from them. They are just scam artists. Liars. They will steal Your money one way or other with the cancellation or with the sections. It's this guy ** the manager from Aventura location that really need to be careful. He is good at convincing people to buy this things and then will say he can't do anything to help or get your money back. He did the same when he was the manager at crunch at Sunny Isles. What a joke is everything and everyone on this gym. I'm glad I cancel even is cost me $1760 which of course make upset but well nothing you can do when you dealing with this kind of people. DON'T you sign anything with them!! You will get ripped off.
799,937899,2015-03-04,1,"I have been with LA Fitness for about a year now. Nice gym. However, I have been locked in a training contract for a year. $220.00 a Month on top of 2 Membership fees (My girlfriend and I - $36.00 each) and I only meant to sign up for 6 months. I have no idea how I was pushed into a year, which by the way they refuse to show me my agreement... It took 4-5 months to find a decent trainer that really cared at all about doing their job. My trainer now is amazing. The billing is dreadful. I can't afford this bill. Not to mention whoever is in charge of billing is terrible. How am I supposed to count on someone billing me on the new mysterious day every month. In Jan this year (2015) it went from the 30th to the 14th. Made me go negative in my bank account, had to get a loan just to clean up after LA Fitness's mess. Well they tried to do it again in Feb. I called to see if someone could fix this. I called and what sounded like a very young kid told me only the 'Customer Service Managers' work with billing. He put me on hold for what must have been 10 minutes. This guy, I think his name was **, comes on the line laughing talking to other people then finally says, ""Hey so this is how it's done. We bill you every 28-30 days."" I explained to him that I was fine with that and asked how it went from the 30th to the 14th. The question was ignored. Then I asked if there was anyway he could work with me and move it back to the 30th. He responds with, ""You are just gonna have to work with your bank because that's just how it's done."" At that point I was officially done with LA Fitness. The only thing I like about this gym is My trainer. ** (From the Location on 1731 S Greenfield Rd, Mesa, AZ 85206). He's awesome, I know how to eat better and work out correctly thanks **! Anyways, The locker room is disgusting and the customer service is rude. I have officially paid LA Fitness $3000.00. $3000.00 is a lot of money. I could have bought a nice car with that amount of money down. This is how I get treated. Well I'm done. I am in process of canceling my contract and my membership. I will never go back. Good Riddance."

On February 2, 2015 I asked to have guest privileges removed from my account because I would not be bringing a guest during the times I was exercising. The employees at the front desk said it was taken care of. On February 25, 2015 my card was charged $54.19. I contacted LA Fitness and was told they had no information about dropping guest privileges from my account. I asked for a refund of the additional $20.00 and was told LA Fitness does not give refunds. I asked that the money be placed towards the next months payment and they said no. I was given an extra 30 days to bring a guest for free. That was all they could do for me. This is insane! I dropped the extra account because I had no use for it! Thieves is what they are.

I am going to reach out to corporate and trust this matter will be handled. I have positive thoughts on this matter. If not, I will nail this company to the wall!! Please do not play with my health!!! When you have an organization geared to help people, scams in this day age will not be tolerated. As a brand, LA Fitness clearly understands based on their advertising - health first!! Payment is not my issue, bait and switch is my concern. I adore my trainer and the manager.

They have an attitude, they are not nice and never helpful at all. As a former member of the club, I had to leave because every time I went there, they always made dirty faces at me and also made me feel bad about myself. No matter what you tell them, nothing changes. Their corporate office phone number is just connected to a club manager and you can not ever get through to their corporate office. They do not accept email from members and basically it seems to me that they just do not care. Also, their Torrance club is dirty inside and out, and worn out looking. The machines never get fixed in a timely manner and they always have an excuse why there are no positive changes. When I told them that I was leaving, they were delighted and told me that I complain more than any other member of the club. Basically, LA Fitness is a waste of money."

We can take care of that now."" So I get immediate service when they want my money but basically begged to be served for 3 weeks with no response. I told them I lived up to my end of contract and they failed on their end so this was unacceptable. They gave me a corporate number to call with the same result. I told them I wanted to terminate but if they take my money it was going to cost them much more as family and friends would not renew their contracts as well. After I hung up, I got an email notifying me my money had been withdrawn. No such thing as customer service here.

The first time I went to cancel they told me it would cost $780 and I wouldn't be able to train anymore. I immediately went back to the person that signed me up and told him he NEVER explained that this was a contracted term of 6 months. The only solution he offered me was to commit fraud by stating I was relocating to an area where LA Fitness wasn't located. I then continued every single month complaining that I didn't have time to even use the trainings and that I NEVER would have signed up for ANY personal training if I had known that there was a contract involved. I continued to pay and pay and pay over $400 a month between my regular membership fees and the personal training package I was ""tricked"" into signing up for. Finally I started attending another gym and spoke to the general manager that stated if I could get proof that the terms and conditions had never been properly discussed that he would offer me a $0 termination!! I couldn't believe that after having paid for 4 months of personal training I wasn't even able to use, that there was a cancellation option that was free of charge!I then contacted the corporate office to discuss the ENTIRE story again (for what felt like the 100th time) and the corporate office ""cancelled"" my personal training and told me that I had 30 days to use the remaining sessions... Fast Forward to two weeks later when my remaining sessions suddenly ceased to exist! I couldn't believe that after everyone I had talked to and all the money I had spent that my sessions just disappeared before the 30 days was up! I then contacted the corporate office to try to resolve the issue and was stuck on the phone with the same person that had initially canceled my agreement only to find out that there was a HUGE miscommunication in which he stated I had agreed to PAY to cancel and I restated the fact that I had only contacted the corporate office in order to receive the $0 cancellation!Long story short, the ""helpful"" corporate office, member services manager, REFUSED to let me speak to anyone else regarding my situation, gave me NO other options other than to lose my sessions or PAY MORE MONEY!

808,927419,2015-02-18,1,"One of the worst service experience I have ever had. They added my flatmate to my family account without informing me and I paid for his membership for 6 months even if he is not in USA. The only reason that they added to my account, we are living in the same house and they couldn't get the payment from his bank account, so it is easy for them just to add him to my account! So wise! So gipsy! Another thing, when I want to cancel my wife's membership they just told me to send mail to headquarters. But why don't you tell it to me while enrolling? Why don't we mail to headquarters while joining club? They think customer service means 'a fake welcome every time you hit the gym.' Please keep away from this club for wellness of your heart."
809,926201,2015-02-17,1,"I never authorized charges to my credit card and they charged 2 months of membership to that same credit card. I contacted LA Fitness and wrote a letter requesting a refund to my credit card and cancelled the membership. They offered to extend my membership (This membership will expire on 12/27/2014 and includes application of your pre-paid dues at the time of enrollment). I wrote a letter telling them: I have been trying to cancel prior 10/29/2014 when my credit card was charged without authorization. I am requesting a refund and I want to cancel immediately. I haven't been able to use LA Fitness facilities for more than 3 months and I currently can't use the facilities. I don't need membership until December 27, 2014. Please cancel and refund my account.LA Fitness did not do anything. I am still trying to resolve the issue with my bank. Advice: never give your bank card to LA Fitness, only a card (i.e. Citicard) that can solve your issues like this one. LA Fitness just want to take your credit card for recurrent charges even though you don't authorize them."
810,925314,2015-02-16,1,"My dad, brother, and I were at the LA Fitness in highland Ca, on February 15 and got locked in! The lady from the front desk told us to get out the Jacuzzi so we got out and got dressed. By the time we got out of the lockers, no one was there. It was pitch black dark. We couldn't see anything and none of the phones were working. The sheriff had to come get us out! Worst experience ever!"
811,924733,2015-02-15,1,"I worked out with a master trainer on 1 occasion as a demonstration of a training session, and it was terrible. The next day, my back felt awful, I couldn't go to work. I called the gym to reduce the number of training sessions I had originally signed up for and the manager assured me they would change my program. Now a month later, they are still billing me for all the original sessions and will not answer my calls or speak with me. The training manager said that it would affect the trainer's commission for the sale who sold me the sessions and he didn't want to do that. Apparently, their sales commissions are more important than their customers. This is not an establishment you should trust, they try to get you committed and then take your money and not deliver. Their supposed master trainers are not properly trained to do the things they say they will."
812,920898,2015-02-10,1,"Just opened an account with Corey on 2/6/15 for my wife and myself. First time in the gym 2/9/15, and we took our 3 kids to kid play area and hit the treadmill and stretched out. I brought a ""Husky"" folder with paper and pen to write down our heaviest weight limit for each exercise (all leg machines). We went to use the smith machine to max out on squats. My wife went first and then right when I was going into my turn I had an assistant manager named SEAN ** come to me in a very threatening body stance and yelling at the top of his lungs in front of about 30 people that I am not allowed to ""coach"" because we have to pay for personal trainers. I was ""coaching"" because I was writing down our progress. I asked to speak with the GENERAL MANAGER EMILY, then he said she was fired and HE was the General Manager. Corey was there and watched both of us working out, so I took Sean to Corey and then Corey lied and said he didn't see anything. I said it, the situation was ** because there is a consumer affair report about the exact same situation happening to a mother and her teenage son. SEAN then intentionally verbally threatened me to take me outside and beat my ass if I had a problem with it in front of Corey. Coming from an experienced fortune 50 Retail store management background, I stated I was shocked at his professional demeanor, and as a BROWN BELT IN HELIO GRACIES JIU JITSU, I would not fight him. I also stated I was a VOLUNTEER SHERIFF OFFICER and I could call the local station on him for CA PC 422 criminal threats which is a FELONY... he quickly refuted his verbal threat and said he was cancelling my account and called me a ** in front of my wife, Corey and other gym members. For my first time at an LA FITNESS and at the POWAY, CA location, I will never go back and expect a refund which they never gave the mom and her son."
813,920707,2015-02-09,2,"I love working out, but this place is not clean. I finally canceled my membership. I heard on the other side of town, they have around the clock housekeeping, but not at this location. I think this is the busiest location in the Atlanta area, but yet treated the worst. As I stated, I love working out, and I was there every day, sometimes twice a day. There was one girl name Anita, who actually cleaned the place like it was her home, but for whatever reason, they got rid of her. I walked out and saw blood on the floor, I saw roaches coming out of the lockers, tissue everywhere and this would be early in the morning. I was like dang, shouldn't this place have been cleaned last night. They stated they were going to upgrade the equipment last year I think, they had shut the gym down, I think for a week or couple of days. I was working out of town, but when I came back, I wondered what they had done. They still had the same broke down treadmills and old equipment. I don't think ANY carpet should be in a gym, as much as people sweat! This place is just not clean, I left, I still have friends there, one of them whom pays up to 2 years in advance, and he is thinking about leaving. He's a well off dude and could be working out at home. We both stated if a Planet Hollywood comes to the Camp Creek Area in Atlanta, GA we will be joining it. They really need around the clock cleaning! People pay too much for filthiness. Friends have stated that they will be contacting The Health Department next, and I would be in line to sign...."
814,919296,2015-02-07,1,"The actual Gym is fine. However, if you would like to actually use the pool - forget it. Let me preface this by saying that everybody should learn to swim - but that is what a YMCA or a school is for. When I joined LA fitness was adults only - you got in... you got out - you went to work. But, now, they opened up the pool to the British swim schools so essentially they are double dipping - getting paid by both LA fitness members and the BSS. They close the lanes for hours at a time on the weekends, and on the busiest hours after work. As an endurance athlete, your long distances are done on the weekend... so, you are screwed. That and the pool doesn't even open until 6 am, and the gym (if you are lucky doesn't even open the door until 8..8:30 ish on the weekends), and then they have the aqua fit class for the older adults... so the lap swim times are very slim. Oh and the pool is closed from 3-4. The reason I joined an LA fitness was because it was ALL lap swim except for one or two aqua fit classes. Now I have to compete with the classes and the kids. Unfortunately for the members, LA fitness is a business, so unless people quit they don't care, and won't do anything about it. They know that it is one of the few pool around...GRRRRRRR. SOOOO just warning folks who could go elsewhere... you might want to consider it."
815,918948,2015-02-07,1,"I joined a couple of days ago online. I get a call from an Adam wanting me to come in for my free assessment. Free iPad, $150.00 to sign up. We go through the assessment - all the tests to show you how fat and out of shape you are - and go through laundry list of question. At the end of it all, they would not set up a workout plan for me unless I sign up for a personal trainer... NOT HAPPY."
816,918722,2015-02-06,1,"LA Fitness claims they will return your money if it is your first time into their gym. I got charged for first and last months' ""dues"" and will not be getting the money back because I was unable to attend the gym within the 3 days I had this offer. I had a police report done and about to do a second one because my cell phone with my ID and check card was stolen from LA Fitness and they will not help to fix the problem or do anything about this. This was my first time into your gym and was in there for roughly 2 hours and that's with looking for my cell phone."

818,918462,2015-02-06,2,"Corporate Office of LA Fitness told my husband they would not honor contract for giving him personal training sessions (77 sessions for me, 45 sessions for him, at $45/session, totaling almost $3,500!) because they expired and were not used within 30 days of my husband paying for them back in 2008. My husband was never told about any cancellation policy and the personal trainer of LA Fitness was not aware of this expired personal training sessions policy until just recently. He did not know of this contract clause, nor did he know LA Fitness was enforcing any such policy. My husband should either get a refund or get the training sessions he paid for!"
819,917379,2015-02-05,1,"The LA Fitness sales person convinced me to purchase some training time because they were having a sale at the time 8 mile & 94.

After several attempts, I finally managed to cancel my gym membership, only to find they continue to take for my Personal Training (which I cannot use without a membership). I have had several attempts to cancel this subscription by mail, with no joy. I am now sending the cancellation form with proof of postage. As others have said, they deliberately make it difficult for you to exit their services.I do not trust their business practices and would not recommend them to others on these grounds."

822,915859,2015-02-03,1,"I joined LA Fitness and was happy with the facility itself and its classes but the management and employees make up for it. Everyone is given a free fitness assessment when they join and then they drag you through why you need a personal trainer. Despite repeated attempts at declining the manager finally convinced me to sign up. I was only going to do it for a couple months to get used to new gym. I go to cancel the contract and come to find out the terms of the contract were not explained to me fully. They want you to pay for at least half of what you don't use. So now they are saying I owe $800! As you can imagine I was furious this wasn't told to me. Come to find out the manager that sold me the contract is no longer there because she wasn't explaining this to customers but they still refuse to let me out of the contract. The employees there are incompetent, rude, and the most unhelpful employees I have ever seen or dealt with. Make sure you do not take any of their word for it. Read, read, read!!!"
823,915096,2015-02-01,1,LA Fitness are training their employees to become horrible people. They are unethical. They make you sign their contracts giving the minimum information without explaining the cancellation policy. They lied to us saying that there is no contract when we ended up with big contract. They said it is a simple phone call to cancel. This is a big lie. The only way is to send a letter to a PO Box and wait until you receive an email to confirm receiving your letter. There is no phone number to call. No giving time when the cancellation will take place. Lawyers please stop them from doing this unethical business. Please someone somehow should sue LA Fitness.
824,914073,2015-01-31,1,Someone broke into my locker on Friday around 8 pm (January 30th). The front desk confirmed another member complained about same thing a bit earlier. They stole all my cash: 150$ and nicely left me the dollar bills. The lock was nowhere to be found. I have members to many gyms and it never happened to me. I will file a claim to the police.
825,913739,2015-01-30,1,"I have an LA Fitness gym membership, the personal training manager asked me if I wanted to do an assessment test for ""free"" and I agreed. After doing test he started trying to pressure me into getting a personal trainer and me thinking ok I might need this for a couple months said alright... While going through the paperwork he did not, I repeat, did not tell me that it was for a whole year. He did tell me that it was month to month and that I could cancel at anytime but I would have to pay half the price (the price of what he did not say). I was led to believe it would be half the price of the monthly payment to cancel which would be $80. Now being a college student that is about to graduate and got accepted into a college out of state where LA did not have a gym, I called to see if I can cancel everything because I would not be using it! Instead they told me I could not cancel but they can put my account on hold and no one could help me! I called corporate, talked to the gym managers, and other employees and they all gave me the run around! I started doing research and realized I am not the only person they have done this to and LA Fitness has been doing it for years! I want to put an end to this, it make NO SENSE to have individuals be able to cancel the gym membership at anytime but not the personal training because you need access to the gym to the able to do the personal training! I have started a motion against LA Fitness and their personal training contract! The link to the motion is attached and I plan on not giving up until they change this contract nonsense! Too many hard working people have been tricked out of their money and will continue to be tricked so help me stand up and say we are not taking this from LA Fitness anymore!!! "
826,913403,2015-01-30,1,"My husband and I joined a gym and decided to look into cost for a personal trainer. The sales rep informed us that there was no commitment and we could cancel at any time. We confirmed that information with the manager at that time. Since we had just bought our first home we didn't were not sure about all of our bills, etc. At the time of us signing we never received a paper copy and were informed we would get it in an email. Upon receipt via email I contacted the branch and was informed by a manager that I had signed and could not cancel. These people lied about everything they had presented to me and my husband."
827,913080,2015-01-29,1,"Two months ago, I went to LA Fitness Arcadia branch to ask for a 2 months contract because I will be there only for one month something. There were 3 staffs I talked to in two days. None of them mentioned that I need to cancel the membership myself when my contract is over. And I have even asked if there will be more billing after, the staff I spoke to at the time said no, that's it. Two months. Two months later, I returned to Denmark. And I got an extra payment from LA Fitness through my credit card. I have tried to call them like 3 times the first day to solve the issue. The answer was that the operation manager is not there. And he never calls back even if I left my number each time. 4 days later, I called again and finally got the chance to speak with him. The lady I spoke to in the beginning wasn't willing to transfer the call to him. I have waited and he was finally there to speak with me. I understand that I didn't go to him to cancel my membership which was his main point. But the way he spoke with me was way out of my imagination. To be honest, a month fee wouldn't kill me. The point is the awful customer service that I have experienced. There was no apologize at all but it was only yourself to blame because you didn't come to me. And there is no refund to the credit card like a million times he repeated. I wasn't make the call to argue but it sounded like he was so ready for this. I had to hang up myself in the end. It was meaningless after all. I really hope these people can respect to their conscience."
828,911357,2015-01-27,1,"My husband signed up for personal training with LA in Oct. Later, after a month he had a surgery and was in a position to go to GYM. So, when we called to cancel the service, they wouldn't do the cancellation until we get a letter from the Dr. saying he is ""Totally Disabled"" and we have to post to LA office. When signing the contract the manager in Atlanta branch was so helpful and did not explain the cancel terms correctly, but to cancel the service he was asked to call LA office, and they are not involved in the cancellation process. It is taking forever to cancel the service even after submitting the letter. My advice to you all is do not ever take personal training with LA, for that matter do not even get a membership in LA."
829,910403,2015-01-26,1,"Bethel Park Facility Shameful - I have been going to this gym, mainly for the classes. But I am seriously looking elsewhere. The instructors are great but the gym itself is dirty, dirty, dirty. They simply do not have hardly any people cleaning. The floor where exercise classes are taught has the same sweat marks day after day (no one mops this floor). Light bulbs have been burned out for two weeks now, so one side of the room is completely dark. There are few anti - bacterial bottles and the solution in it has been watered down so much you wonder if it's even effective. Very little equipment for the classes. Classes are few, which causes serious overcrowding. Most classes are geared towards seniors. Only ONE decent class during the day per week for anyone under age 50 (boot camp, great class only on Mon., rest of the classes are evenings).Overall: poor maintenance, dirty facility, not enough classes, over-crowding in (decent) classes, old and insufficient equipment for exercise classes (except for spinning bikes which are the only new thing in the entire building). Would NOT recommend."

831,907944,2015-01-23,1,"I first contacted LA Fitness about cancelling my membership on 9/1/14. I asked the rep on the phone regarding cancellation and they directed me to a link. Each time I attempted to go online, it would not allow me to print the cancellation form. I went to the fitness club several times but on several occasions, the general manager left early for the day or had not come in. I called the corporate office again and informed them about my difficulties of accessing the cancellation form and getting in touch of the club manager. They continue to put me in circles, I got fed up, dropping the medical documentation at the club. The cancellation finally got process but much later than I planned. I received the refund; however, for a lesser amount than I anticipated. I feel the company misguided me in order to provide me a smaller refund."
832,906465,2015-01-21,1,"I had been a member of LA Fitness for 10 years and had been paying my membership fee consistently even if I rarely use it. I have a group membership with my friend and my sister. After a long period of time of not going to the gym due to my pregnancy and child birth on 2013, I decided to attend Jody's Kickboxing class yesterday, Monday, January 19, 2015, at 5:45 pm. Jody's kickboxing class is the one and only class and also the one and only reason I go to LA Fitness in Northridge. I excitedly left work early to arrive at the gym for the 5:45 pm class on time. I came in to the club and had my ID card scanned, right when the front desk person gave my card back to me I rushed towards the room where Jody had already started her class. Before I even had a chance to open the door, the front desk person came behind me and asked me to go back to the front desk. I immediately followed her and when we got there, another LA Fitness employee together with Max **, who I was not aware at that time was the club's manager, started telling me that my membership had been cancelled since October of 2014. He started interrogating me and asking me questions as if he was insinuating that I was lying and denying about my lack of knowledge of the membership cancellation. He, together with the 2 other front desk employees, treated me as if I was sneaking in to the gym. Again, he was asking me unnecessary questions about my payments. I told him that I was not the main person in the membership and that my friend was the one paying for our membership. He made a very unprofessional comment, so, you owe your friend money that's why she cancelled the membership. I told him that I usually pay my friend the entire year's membership to avoid the hassle of monthly payments. He insisted that I get my credit card so I can sign up before he lets me in to the gym. I politely asked Max ** if I can just attend Jody's kickboxing class first and sign up after since the class had already started. I even requested if he could give me a FREE guest pass just like what the club does for potential members but he rudely stated that, you are not a new member because you cancelled your membership so I cannot let you in. Again, after asking him if I could as a member of LA Fitness for 10 years just attend this one class with a promise to sign up after but he repeatedly refused and insisted that if I had already gotten my credit card and signed up, I would have been done and already in Jody's class. I was appalled by all his comments and the way he treated me. I felt belittled by his questioning and discriminated because of his assumptions that I was sneaking in. I was very composed the whole time. I politely left the club to breathe. I came back in to ask if I could speak with Max ** again but he was on the phone. I asked the 2 front desk employees for his name but they refused to give it to me. While on the phone Max signaled to another Sales Rep to assist me thinking I came back to sign up. I asked the Sales Rep for the manager's name and said that its Max. When I asked for the last name, she said, It's just Max. I asked her how can she not know the last name of their manager and she replied, Its hard to pronounce and I can't spell it out. Setting aside the issue with the manager, they have a serious problem with their employees. These other employees also need to be trained on proper customer service or on just plain morale and ethics. They were signaling to each other to not give me the manager's name. I found out Max's last name by doing a Google search on complaints at LA Fitness Northridge Max and there appeared on the search some other online complaints against this person.I have been loyal to LA Fitness for a decade even if I was just paying for nothing since I rarely go. My friend and my sister likewise rarely use their membership which probably was the reason of the cancellation. I was not aware of this since I am used to paying my friend on an annual basis without a need for any communication. I did not have a slight intention of sneaking in to your gym. I complied and went back to the front desk when asked. I politely requested from your manager, Max, to be given a one class trial so I can attend Jody's class but he strongly refused. I understand that the membership was cancelled but it would have been a good customer service gesture to allow a long-time customer whose membership was just cancelled a few months ago after paying for years, an entry to one class. I repeatedly said that I will sign up after the class since it will take time to fill up the form and process payment and the class will be over by then. Max ** acted inappropriately and rudely. I felt discriminated when I was not allowed a one-time entry to the gym that I have been paying/going to for a long time when they just give out FREE passes to random people to try out the gym for a month. This is not acceptable! I was only asking to use the pass for one class and will sign up again as a member. This is not how you treat an old member or a person in general. Max lied when he said old members cannot be given a guest pass. Do you have a printed policy on this? I'm writing this complaint so they can address the serious lack of training of their employees and their inability to hire good employees who will treat the customers right."
833,905522,2015-01-20,1,"Had a good experience with LA Fitness until I tried to cancel. They make it so you have to go into the gym 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday which is impossible for someone who works regular work hours. Then you ask other options and any gym you call is rude about it and laugh because you have no options. They change their contract rules without informing their members (because I was informed I could go in any time and cancel since I signed up at 7pm, but due to recent changes with no warning, no longer allow this). And the only other way to cancel is if you mail in your cancelling which they said takes a minimum of two weeks so you have to pay for an extra month that you will not use. Not happy. Will not get another membership with this gym."
834,904537,2015-01-18,1,"Having just joined LA Fitness this week, and after using it for only the second time, I have several complaints, all indicative that this club is not being managed very well. Women's locker room showers. On Saturday, Jan 17, 2015, at 8:30 a.m., there was no hot water. The water was barely lukewarm after running it for several minutes. The attendant said she did not know anything about this, even though the club had been open since 5:30 a.m. There is very bad water flow from the shower heads in the women's locker room. This may be due to a calcium build up, which could be remedied with a good vinegar soak. But new shower heads are very inexpensive and are definitely indicated here. On Thursday, Jan 15, 2015, at 10:30 a.m., the women's locker room showers looked like they had not been cleaned in at least several days. There were also long strands of hair in the drains of all 6 showers. This Saturday morning, they looked like they had been cleaned, with no hairs in the drains either, so this was good. My question remains, how often are the women's showers cleaned? Does management ever check? Lap pool. On Thursday, all 6 lap lanes were full the entire time. I asked at the front desk what their policy was when all the lanes were full, and they just shrugged. This morning, Saturday, Jan 17, 2015, at 8:30 a.m., all lanes were full with two people waiting when I walked into the club. I asked the person at the desk what happened when all the lanes were full. She said, ""Oh, are all the lanes full? I didn't know that."" All she had to do was look to her right. Duh! (Are you seeing a pattern here?) Evidently, it is first-come, first-serve, and one just has to wait for a lane to open. I waited 20 minutes for a lane to open this morning. Three of the lanes still had the same swimmer in them after I left after 20 minutes of swimming. Since some people do like to swim for at least an hour, it would be nice if something could be done about just having to wait for a lane. This pool is always full of swimmers. Sauna in women's locker room was barely hot at all. The heat needed to be turned up majorly. The woman at the front desk said the manager would not be in until Monday. So there is no management all weekend. So, overall, I am really not happy. LA Fitness did give me a good deal on membership - no sign-up fee. So I am wondering how much longer this gym is going to be in business."
835,902702,2015-01-15,1,"I was a member for about 3 years, then moved away and let my membership expire at the contract end-date. That didn't stop this bunch of low lifes from calling me at least 10-15 times, despite my first 4-5 attempts to tell them that I would not renew. ""Oh, sorry, we didn't know you had already told us that."" **. They simply harass people to get you to rejoin. I heard someone compare LA fitness reps to a bunch of used-car salesmen, but I think that's incredibly unfair to used-car salesman, who are more ethical than this bunch. Avoid them at all costs."
836,901986,2015-01-15,1,"I would pay 100x the amount of money to have my child supervised better. With my first child 7 years ago, security was a lot better at other jobs. This LA Fitness has the childcare right up front completely covered in glass windows, no blinds, no tint. Anyone driving by the gym can just watch your children. It's creepy. No cameras. No locks, no codes. One or two young girls or an elderly woman watching your children. When you work out you can't see entrance to kids club but everyone outside can, and anyone just walking in the door can. Don't trust this sorry excuse."
837,898604,2015-01-09,1,"I have a son who is in college working on a doctorate. I am terribly concerned about his weight gain. I went into the Lake Zurich, IL LA fitness center. I wasn't certain between work and school he could do it but I'm dad. I was floored by the cost of instruction but he's my son and I'm concerned so I swallowed the cost @ 200.00 for training and 29.99 a month for membership. I was floored and the instructor assured me not to worry so I took solace in his assurances. Now the plot thickens. He obviously couldn't handle it. I call in December just a couple of months into it. I said keep the membership but cancel the training and explained the situation. I was assured not a problem. I get billed in January and call the provided number and behold you can't cancel unless you pay half the cost of this ridiculously expensive service you never received. I'm out a 1000.00 dollars for absolutely nothing. They said ""you should have read the fine print."" I said ""your sales folks should warn prospective clients of the back out charges.""I would have never committed knowing of the penalty. They blame me. I blame them for shady business practices and horrible community involvement being a large ""what I thought was reputable business."" I was wrong. DISGUSTING, BEWARE OF THE FINANCIAL TRAP. We have tuition, books, meals, transportation and all the above for school and now 1000.00 dollars to these corporate jerks. Never again. WARN PEOPLE OF THESE BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES. UNETHICAL AND WITHOUT ANY HESITATION TO SAY ""TOO BAD FOR YOU"" WAS THE RESPONSE TO MY PLEA!"
838,895858,2015-01-05,1,"Due to a job relocation, I was forced to cancel my membership. Thirty-two personal training appointments had accrued on my account due to my job requiring travel. When I put in my cancellation request I asked for a refund on the unused appointments. According to their policy, all appointments that have been paid for are non-refundable for any reason. They are also non-transferable so I can't even give them to a family member. Unless I can use 32 appointments in 10 days, LA Fitness will have effectively stolen over $1000 from me for services that have not been rendered. Then they have the audacity to tell me that if I were to rejoin in the future, they may be able to give me some of the sessions back. I replied that I will never be back after this treatment not to mention that there are, and most likely won't, be any clubs within 30 miles of my new residence. Avoid corporate training like the plague!"
839,895545,2015-01-05,5,"I have been getting multiple multiple phones calls from L.A. Fitness daily for payment on my account. My bank account was breached and the bank blocked my account until I receive new account information. I told L.A. Fitness that once I get my account back in order, I will submit the monthly payment. This has only been two to three weeks and everyday I get calls from them 2-5 times a day. My phone is also my work phone and I have told them every time to stop calling the number. I am fully aware a payment is needed and will make the payment. This is harassment and a total disrespect with for my. Does anyone else have this experience?"
840,894620,2015-01-03,1,"I used to go to Vision Quest gym, where I only paid $19 a month. LA Fitness bought that gym, but they promised all Vision Quest members that they would still get to pay the Vision Quest price, $19. At that time, I froze my account because I wasn't going to go to the gym for a little. LA promised that if I unfreeze my account within 6 months, I would not be charged any fees and I would still continue paying $19. They gave me paperwork and I received an email to prove it. Couple months later, I decided to go back to the gym. The manager that was unfreezing my account told me I needed to pay a $60 fee. I showed her the paperwork and emails that stated I didn't have to pay any fees but she ignored them and told me she wouldn't unfreeze my account unless I paid. I, of course, was annoyed but paid it anyway. Later that day, I checked my online bank statement and there were 3 separate transactions of $60 dollars charged out of my account! So she charged me $180! I was furious. I called the gym and explained the situation to them and they told me the manager would call back when she got back from break but she never did. So I called the next day and the same thing happened. So I drove all the way to the gym so I can speak to her in person and had to wait a whole hour for her to finally come out of her office. She told me it was a mistake but she couldn't do anything about it so I had to call the corporate office. After wasting almost a whole day calling people and being on hold for hours, I finally reached someone and they told me I would be refunded. A week later. I was upset so I cancelled my account with them. They told me I would be charged $19 one more time because the account only cancels after 30 days. So couple days after that, I had a $19 charge on my account. About ten days later, I had a random $30 charge on my account from LA Fitness. I had enough of this. I called them again. The girl I talked to was angry and rude and told me the manager would call me back. But guess what? She never did! I came to realize that LA Fitness attempts to rob people of their money and when problems occur, they don't care to help solve them."

843,892609,2014-12-30,1,I had knee surgery. After I finish my therapy I wanted to try a trainer for a couple months. I made known to LA fitness I just wanted a 2-month term. She talk me into a contract and said I can come and cancel anytime. Well with travel on my job and other problems I forgot to cancel. And I received no training. I did not hear from LA fitness for 5 months. I saw a bank statement showing that they were taking the $135 per month for a trainer faithfully each month. I went to cancel and they said no. The person who signed me up no longer work there. No manager ever called for me to come for my training session. My bank card got hacked 2 weeks ago so they block any transaction. Guess who has called me everyday for 3 days in a row looking for their money? One day they called twice. Where were LA fitness the 5 months I was paying for training and getting nothing?? I am taking the training sessions because unless I pay a buyout I am stuck with this contract. I want to cancel but cannot. I don't like or approve of the way they do business. Can't wait for this contract to end.

Rude, no patience, and he sounded very annoyed. I will not sign up again with LA fitness."
845,890857,2014-12-26,1,"Don't be fooled by their agents/manager. All they care about is to get you signed into their ""worry-free"" membership. In time it will turn around to be a contract that will take from you a hassle to get out off. I called and canceled my membership years ago.... The person on the phone told me “Do not worry, it’s canceled.” It’s been more than 4 years that they have been charging my account 10$ per month since then... Apparently the only way to get out of the contract is by sending a certified letter to a PO box somewhere and wait until you get a confirmation, if you did not get it and move forward with life you are screwed. They make it difficult for a purpose. Ugly way of doing business much like their fitness centers. "
846,889582,2014-12-23,1,"I signed up for a personal training contract at LA Fitness in New Tampa a few months ago. The salesperson was Bruno **. I travel for a living, therefore I was going to sign up for a single session per week and use the accrued sessions whenever I was in town. Bruno told me that the sessions I purchased would not expire 30 days after I completed my contract (despite it being written into the contract) and gave me a story about a man who signed up, traveled to India for a year, and returned home to use his sessions because ""LA Fitness does not pay attention to the expiration date"". This is a lie that was brought up when I asked if I could keep my sessions if I were to cancel my contract. To add to the issue, the personal trainer did not even show up for the last two personal training sessions I scheduled."
847,888517,2014-12-21,2,"I use the Troy MI LA fitness club. The overhead TV monitors have been showing FOX News channel consistently since last 8 months. Fox is well known to be a politically biased channel. I complained to the manager in writing and delivering the letter by mail as well as at the front desk, asking to refrain from showing the channel or show politically opposing channel at the same time on other TV screens, to be fair. Lately they have been showing paid advertising on one or two of the other screens- which is also objectionable, but the Fox viewing continues on one of the channels. No action or response has been received since my response 2 months ago. Does this club wants to stay politically biased?"

After 15 minutes I asked ""was he coming"", I was then told he had to go to court, and would not arrive till ten o'clock, apt was for nine. I asked if they thought I was supposed to sit till he arrived, they then told me they would get someone to help me, to please have a seat again and someone would help me soon. The young lady had been sitting at her desk all the time I was waiting. I must say when they called her she came right over, but she informed me that she does not do assessments, and would try to find someone who could maybe help me. That I could feel free to use the equipment, I informed her that I had never been to a gym. She said maybe one of the others could help, but she was not sure. I chose to leave at this point. I know things happen, but I am upset as to why I had to ask when he would be arriving, and why they did not get someone to assist me till I asked. The young lady was upset also because she said they should have informed her right away. But they choose to continue on with their private conversation instead of customer service."

More than a year ago, I told them to replace the broken filter, be used to filter out the dirt floating on the surface of the Spa Pool. So far it has not been replaced yet!!! Spa pool has been out of order since mid of October. It was promised that it would be fixed in 2 weeks. Up today, they have done nothing. I have no idea what these managers have been doing there. Terrible!!! I request to extend my membership for 3 months starting the mature date (09/15/2017). Please tell the La fitness in Melville. NY to have it fixed in no time. Thank you."

A career thief is going around stealing from LA Fitness' locker and nothing is being done about it. After doing research, I see there have been many thefts. They have no surveillance camera or security guard on the inside or outside of the building. It's like they don't care as long as they get their monthly payments. If my son is exercising with a career thief, there can be molesters, rapists, murderers etc. in the building and we don't know. They do not warn their customers by posting warning signs, and refuse to have a security person or a security camera. THEY DO NOT CARE!"
851,885646,2014-12-16,1,"Avoid like the plague, unless you enjoy being a sucker! 'Angel' and another employee at the facility in Encinitas, CA signed me up for a three year term pre-paid membership on February 23, 2014, lying to me when answering my question about my ability to cancel mid-term and receive a pro-rated refund, without additional charges or fees: this ability was represented to be unconditional; then they avoided giving me a signed copy of the agreement to read later. Turns out now, December 16, 2014, that there was a five day rescission period in February where I would have discovered the deception (if I had a copy of the agreement) and truly been able to cancel, which I certainly would have done. I qualified their answer to this important question about cancellation very carefully, and the effect of what they responded was a LIE. The facility on Dove Canyon Road, San Diego (Rancho Bernardo) is not maintaining its equipment well, with the jacuzzi tripping a circuit breaker so it is unusable just about every other morning when I am there. The problem has existed well over a month, despite numerous complaints from myself and others. It follows on the heels of another problem that existed for several months before they found the money to replace a pump. I wrote them an email and blind copied the San Diego Fire Department about the circuit breaker: I doubt their fire and casualty insurance will cover damage resulting from negligence.There is more, and I have been very patient up to now. Being refused a right to cancel my membership now by the corporate office despite being told about the deception by their employees, I have to conclude this company lacks ANY integrity. You are at risk to trust them with your money or your health, in my opinion. I am sure they are laughing behind the backs of people like me who they have wronged and who later found out."
852,885570,2014-12-16,1,"In September, I found out I was moving more than 50 miles away from an LA Fitness (which is what is required to be excused from their contract). Prior to my move, I talked to my local club and was told I needed to send a change of address confirmation to their Corporate Office in order to cancel (which you receive at your new address only, making it impossible to cancel before I moved). In October, I mailed LA Fitness the necessary documents to cancel my account and was told they did not receive them. I again in November took the time to mail another letter. Both letters had correct postage and a return address. Neither letter was returned to me. LA Fitness CLAIMS they have not received either and REFUSE to accept the documents electronically. It is now DECEMBER, I am still being billed, and now they are saying that I need to pay $7.00 to send the letter certified to process my request - so basically, they are THROWING AWAY cancellations that are not sent certified because you, as a lowly consumer, cannot PROVE that you mailed them. Dealing with this horrible company has been an absolute NIGHTMARE."

For over a year I was charged for two separate accounts and not knowing. Today I called the number that tell the website and said it could not be done nothing then decided to cancel and informed me that I can not also do this online or by phone. Treatment to Menbros clubs is the worst there is. While I'm doing my exercises, coaches ** sell the personal service of trainer by an exaggerated price and are very annoying and pushy.

855,883347,2014-12-11,2,"Was all excited to start my fitness goals. New city, new job, new gym. Manager was pleasant so was the rep. I was thrown all sorts of selling pitches; gym was close to home, was getting a discount rate plus I could add family members as well. Very straightforward (or so I thought). I had asked all the right questions. Could I cancel the family membership as I wasn’t sure... Yes, both manager and rep said, “You just need to call in 10 days if they are not interested.” “Do I have to do it in person?” I asked. “Nope, you just need to inform us by phone.” I was in... no real loss here. I paid first and last for myself and family members. On the eve before my 10 deadline was up? Called to cancel ONLY the family membership and keep mine. Was told manager wasn't in so I had to go in person. I was a little ticked but I live close enough - was there in 15 mins. Then all seemed to work out - I decided to cancel my own membership as well... little feelings of doubt were starting to creep in. I received no written communication just a verbal ""done"". Refused to take 7-10 days. 11 days later I call to follow up. Rep at time advised coz I paid with Visa debit. It could take up to 21 days. Was never advised of this when I inquired about refund process before I signed up. I was still patient. I let them know exactly what I thought of process. On day 21 again I call. Rep now advised money was refunded. I confirm it wasn't and she insisted that's what system showed. She confirmed an amount I hadn't paid. I told her refund was almost double that. I was offered a call back only to be informed that there was an error in the process and only my membership actually got cancelled but not my family's and this correction would take an additional 21 days. Their excuse was the rep I dealt with was inexperienced and had since left. I was given the whole ""nothing we can do speech"" so asked for head office number... The rep there was in the U.S. and was also pleasant but again he assured it would be resolved in 7-10 days not 21. Today is day 49. Am still waiting on my refund. I work for a financial institution to know there's more to this story but at this point I just want my money back and forget their name. Based on the stories here it happens very often. Just disappointed a well-known gym can be this incompetent and claim international status."
856,882765,2014-12-10,1,"I had lost 80 lbs recently and got zumba certification at another club. We were all thrilled L A Fitness was coming and when I finally got the call, I was thrilled! Marketing health and fitness felt great at the time back in May... then I realized wow they don't really care about anyone 's fitness goals. They just want ""deals"" meaning membership sales. Furthermore, if it were such a reputable company who should we go out and literally ""beg"" for people to try them out? I also think making outbound calls to beg again is intrusive. Plus they don't pay you on your day off when they want you to come in for trainings. Furthermore, they do not help you transfer to another department expediently and efficiently. Before I left last week I even told management I was in the process of having the group fitness manager review my videos to audition. What happened later was unacceptable. This young black guy gets promoted only because he had high sales number... it got so much to his head that every time I had to work with him every Saturday was always an ego power tripper. He is rude and disrespectful to women and has shouting matches if you make mistakes. I finally had to give in to being human again and left during my duty recently. Then I find out that group fit manager is in town doing open. Auditions. I tried to explain to her the situation and I wanted a response to see how I can get back as a zumba instructor since I was treated unfairly and unprofessionally. There was no response fro my text since I sent it at noon. What kind if company does this to people who want to be able to move on to another department and they don't do anything to help? Don't work here... you will feel miserable. At the end you feel like you ate just begging or taking people's money. There is no professional and I able satisfaction."

They let minor kids under 11 in pool to play and another wear street clothes in pool. Management ignored my passive complaint, so I shared with other members in Spanish to check with management and told them about policies. Management said I was causing problems. It got worse, but I am a professional and I called the authorities to protect me in the parking lot and asked management to have a female employee in the women's changing room so the 2 unaccompanied minor would be with an adult as I did not want them to feel uncomfortable since I complained. Manager was Hispanic and lied about me and I know Spanish. Being honest and American and fair and speaking English as a primary language must not be okay at this club."

Just came in after using it for about a month and a half and they inform me, “Ma'am you don't have child care on there.” Excuse me. It's 15 dollars extra. I spoke to someone and they said well, some LA fitness gyms must have overlooked it? Really? Then for their mistake I'm supposed to pay more?? So it was fixed and I had to pay first and last months childcare. That is just one issue. Someone who left a gym of 5 years and never had a problem, this is sad. Everyone passes the buck.

On the day I signed up, the Manager named Omar explained to me why I am paying two months membership and 40 for my two kids. He said that if times comes I would freeze or cancel my membership, the one month you deposited in advanced is for that issue. So that means if you decide to freeze your membership, you don't need to pay the last month before you totally freeze your membership. So incidents happened that I have to go out of state for some months in that case, I would need to freeze my account. I freeze it last Nov 18. When I talked the first time to one of the gym receptionist, she told me that I can still work out til January 22. But later on, I was told that I can only workout til Dec 1 and they still charged my credit card. I have one month deposit as well as kids club after freezing it. So in that case I can still go til Dec 22 but the blonde receptionist insist that I cannot work out anymore.This gym is overcharging clients. I will give this one star."

I've attempted to update information on the website and it will not allow me to do so. My credit card has been hacked and I refuse to give this information over the phone or to any of their staff. The facility needs upgrading. The equipment needs repairs. The padding on the equipment is torn and needs replacement. The weights need to be picked up and replaced. It becomes a hazard to walk through the weight lifting area. The staff has no clue as to what customer service entails. Save yourself some money and look elsewhere. I know there are better maintained and less expensive gyms out there. I have cancelled my membership at the Glendora Facility (even though I love the guys I play racquetball with). GOOD LUCK to anyone joining this facility."

Shortly after the manager approached to inform me that my pass expired. Without offering me an alternative to workout and extend pass as a courtesy she demanded that I leave and threaten to call the police. I requested to speak to manager. I was taken aback to be informed that my encounter was with the operation manager. For obvious reasons I won't be joining. If the leader or manager of the facility has a lack of customer service skills, imagine how her staff conduct themselves with her as an example.

This cost us an annual fees of £9000 which is quite a big amount of money. As a result my wife had to terminate her gym membership. One of the clauses of joining the gym contract was if there is a change in our financial circumstances, we can terminate the gym membership by giving them 1 month notice which we did properly. We also emailed the head of the department at La Fitness, my wife's admission firm along with the fees letter as proof of change in our financial circumstances. In spite of all these communication, La Fitness kept bombarding us with reminder letters to pay the membership fees for the period after our termination notice. They have become so shameless that they are also threatening us with debt collection agency to recover their dues. There is no acknowledgment of all the evidence we provided to prove the change in our financial circumstances."

On November 20 of 2014 around 10.30 a.m. I was passing your club in Orlando near Lee Vista Blvd. I have got Interest of your Club long time ago. So that time I decided to see everything with my own eyes. As I walked inside the Receptionist have not paying attention to walking people - he was on a phone. Which is fine. I have waited for 1 minute or so, until he responded me. As soon as he ask me what I want, I have not have time answer him, he continued to talk over the phone. As I heard conversation was not related to work, I was waiting again. After I have asked him if I can use the bathroom. He answer that it's a private club and no one can use it unless you are a member. He was still on a phone. I have asked to talk to Manager. He responded he is the Manager. Let me tell you about myself. I am not drinking or drug person. My clothes was neat and clean, because I was going to important meeting. Usually I get along with most of people without of conflicts. But it was 'outstanding' experience for whole my life. So, I was insisted to come in, he let me in and right after he said that, he changed his mind and I am not allowed to come in because of my attitude. I was confused. So I asked him again if I can use the bathroom and he said No. It took attention from other people, which have made a line already. For me it was very insulting to beg for the restroom in front of other people. So I had to leave. I have asked him about his name, he said it's John. Not sure that this is his real name as his position to be a manager of that Facility.I have been working myself in hospitality business over 3 years and know how customer service standards looks like. Also It's really surprising me because by law, public facility as Store or Gym or anything else have to have a bathroom for both gender with public access. From now on neither Me or neither my friends or relatives will be members of that Club. I am sorry about People who have to have a deal on a daily basis with this type of service or Managers."
867,872497,2014-11-21,1,"As unhealthy & out of Shape I was in, it took a whole lot for me to get back in Shape. I started working out at home w/ Hasfit & Ran miles at the School track. Slowly but surely I had my husband, brothers & sisters join me. It was definitely a positive motivation at this point in my life. Getting closer to winter I had suggested that a gym would suffice due to inclement weather. So I started looking into Gyms & tested all the Gyms out seeing which was convenient, motivating & affordable! My 1st choice was LA Fitness in Kent Wa. Kristi was Amazing! As well as the Front desk. They met all my expectations & gave us a 3 day pass to try out the Gym. I fell in love, & Unfortunately we were only able to use one day due to work & personal circumstances. I tried contacting Kristi but our schedules weren't getting along. A week later I found out there was a gym on Redondo which was .6 miles closer to my house & had advised my husband of my decision & reasons why LA would be a perfect match for us! He agreed & we went in & signed up with George! We were ecstatic about our choices we made & Signed up. I had advised George of trying to get my siblings, Parents & aunts & Uncles & he was very understanding & was willing to extend the previous 4 since I was still working on them into improving their lives! As we were leaving I had asked the front desk, “Y'all are open Thanksgiving?” He says “Yes, Some of us don't have families.” I apologized & said “well they have Churches that are always welcoming like ours.” He started laughing & Stated that he doesn't believe in God & I tried to discontinue the conversation seeing how he rudely interrupted my sentence. I apologized & walked to the other end of the counter since he was a bit agitated. He kept going saying how churches are the biggest hustlers & they just want your money & that he's been to Israel & Jesus ain't white with blonde hair & Blue eyes. I was Very Offended & felt threatened to how he was saying it loudly looking at me straight in my eyes with a lot of hate shaking his head! I'm Not a confrontational person. I start shaking when someone is being very loud in my face about something I'm passionate about! So we ended up leaving & I was regretting signing My husband & I up that day. Contemplating that next day on my decisions to either get a Refund or go forth with something I was prolonging. I ended up going with my husband to work out at the Kent location. They honestly have Awesome service there! It changed my mind again! I was looking forward to going the next day but my husband ended up in the ER with a bad infection. We had gotten released today 11/20/14 & I was excited to proceed forth with my days that I missed & was in need of it tremendously being in the hospital for 2 1/2 days.Due to my husband in need of a few days to heal, I took my brother who George had called to come in & 12 other guests on my VIP list. I tried explaining what was explained thoroughly to me when signing up for a membership. I specifically let George know about 4 of them starting the 3 day trial but only ended up using one day. But the Lead/Supervisor would not let me explain. He was aggressive & kept eating my words. He would not let me get a sentence let alone a word to try & explain. He turned us away cold & then said “Sorry but you can get a $15 pass for the day or sign up for a membership,” & walked away. Not only did I talked my brother who just got off work to Making ""No Excuses"" and hit the Gym with me, I had to drive my brother back home which was 15.7 miles & Gas. I also ended up losing my motivation, excitement & hope in picking the right Gym for me. I felt tears on the way back home forming, just because everything in that moment & time was hopeless for me! :/ When someone says that ""We'll take care of you - this will be your second home"" I invest my time & money in where I feel welcomed. This experience with this facility has caused me to think otherwise with their Push over remarks, insulting religious comments & VERY POOR service. We will be canceling our memberships by the end of this week when I find available time in my schedule. I just won't push forth to being treated poorly or being belittled by Anyone nor will I want my Family to endure such harassments. Hoping to seeing something done or you're looking at losing more customers. A Happy customer will be a Loyal one! That's always Good for business. Best regards."
868,872094,2014-11-20,1,"I drove to the location where I was a member of at 6:00pm. I approached the people behind the kiosk. I informed them ""I need to cancel my membership."" After a girl looked up my account, she informed me that I had ""just missed the manager"" and I need the manager to cancel my membership. I then asked if there was any other way to cancel because the manager works from 8:00 - 6:00. I was asked to give them my email address and instructions would be sent to me. I opened the email the next day & found that I must first create an account online so I can cancel my membership. But, you must know your membership # in order to create an account. (That would have been good to know, when I was there yesterday!) So, now I'm forced to take off work early to drive to the location again. I approach the kiosk where there was 2 young girls and 1 man occupying it. Both of the girls look like they just got out of bed and one was sitting on the counter with her back to the door talking to the man.The moment I said that I was there to cancel my membership, the man walked briskly out of the kiosk area. I was then informed that I ""just missed the manager"" he went to lunch. The time was 2:20 in the afternoon. I was assured that my membership would be canceled when he returns. When I asked why that couldn't have happened yesterday and that I had to take off work early today in order to get the manager during his normal working hours. I was informed that it was just their policy. Their policy needs to change and the manager shouldn't run away when a customer wants to cancel."
869,870993,2014-11-18,1,"I told the sales rep that I'd only be in the country for another 6 weeks at most, he assured me that it was no problem, pushed, pushed, pushed the personal training, assuring me that that I could receive training for a few weeks and that would be that. I wasn't able to read the contract, the sales rep 'read' the contract to me (or really summarized it) off of his computer screen, and I consented with my initials on a computerized pad (naively, in retrospect). A little after a week, I hadn't received any training and decided that I hadn't really had the time to invest and then I got slammed with a surprise that came with a copy of the contract (the first one I'd ever seen): ""You can't cancel this contract! You can 'buyout' of the program for $600."" I told them I didn't have this money, that there's no way I ever would've signed up for a one-year contract when I wasn't planning on being in the States for the year and then I got charged another $100. Apparently, the contract allows them to hold debit cards hostage and the only recourse was to cancel it. Sleazy, predatory business practices and for what they actually do offer, even the basic gym membership is obscenely overpriced. In the end, I worked out for a month (paying $80, they bill two months consecutively) and then basically 'donated' $250. Avoid."
870,870439,2014-11-17,3,"Thanks to filing complaints with the BBB and the Attorney General, the company agreed to cancel the personal training contract by providing me with a buyout waiver. Please always advocate for what is fair. Hope this experience serves others. Thank you for taking the time to read this review. However, this never happened. I continued to get charged $188 plus the $29 for gym. I was trying to reach an agreement with LA Fitness Saugus and Corporate for over 2 months. They said that my only ""option"" to unlock me from contract is to pay 50% of balance (almost $1,000). I signed a contract with the understanding and acceptance that it will be for 30 days, even if the written contract said that it was for 12 months. LA Fitness lied about the terms of a contract to persuaded me to sign it- this is ""fraudulent misrepresentation of contract."" There are consumer protective laws that defend consumers from fraud and I will speak to the media if LA Fitness refuses to correct/repair this situation. Please let me know if you are in a similar situation."
871,869727,2014-11-16,1,"Shortly after I signed up for a membership I realized it wasn't for me. Following their instructions in their contract, I mailed a cancellation notice in a timely fashion. They ignored my letter and continued to bill me. I had to get a refund from my credit card company and block further access. Despite the letter and several phone conversations in which I informed the caller that this was cancelled, they continue to try to charge my card and harass me with phone calls day and night."
872,869683,2014-11-16,1,DO NOT GET PERSONAL TRAINING FROM LA FITNESS. It is a complete rip off! I was led to believe that there was a $200 initial fee for personal training then $40 a month. Now I am being charged the 200 plus 180 a month for a whole year. It is not worth it because they say you get an hour of personal training and on the schedule it is a 30 minute training process but you actually only get 25 minutes of training and the rest of the hour is up to you to repeat what you were shown in those 25 minutes and do an additional 2 sets of each exercise. What is the point of paying 180 a month for 4 25-minute sessions? COMPLETE RIP OFF.
873,868768,2014-11-14,1,"My wife wanted to sign up with a personal trainer so that she could more importantly learn swimming as well as learn some exercises that would be particularly helpful for her neck and back pain. The representative led us on a free fitness assessment and talked to us and we agreed on doing personal training for only a couple of months. While signing the contract, we saw that the agreement was for 52 weeks. We pointed that out before signing and made sure with our representative that we would be able to cancel within a couple months. He assured us that all we would have to do is give notice a month prior in order to cancel. We signed the finalized contract and she started with her personal training. In September, my wife went to the doctor due to horrible back pain and she was instructed to stop her swimming. She decided at this point to stop all personal training starting the month of October. We informed the representatives and they told us it was taken care of. We got billed again for the month of October. We went back to the representatives and told them again that we would like to stop all billing and personal training. They said it was taken care of for the second time yet, we also got billed for the month of November. We were misrepresented during the initial signing of the contract. If we knew that we would not be able to cancel the training after a couple of months, and would be subject to being charged for 12 months of training we never would have signed up in the first place. The only reason we did, was because we were told that we could cancel at any time. We do not appreciate being taken advantage of. We put our trust into your representative and took him for his word. When he told us that we could cancel at any time while signing the contract, breaking the 52 week contract, we didn't have him write anything down or sign a separate document stating him saying this agreement of canceling at any time. You guys should not misrepresent these type of things to people and then charge them later on. This is a horrible way to do business. We have heard many horror stories regarding LA Fitness and how they conduct business. Taking advantage of your members will end in them eventually losing business of loyal customers."
874,867614,2014-11-12,1,"Several trips to the Redlands office were made to cancel the membership, the first story was a manager had to cancel it and was not available. Next, when a manager was available, they indicated I signed up for annual contract and needed to pay entire year if I were to cancel. Frustrated and wasted lots of time. Meanwhile yet another unused month was billed."
875,867324,2014-11-12,1,"Dirty, Smells, Machines are always sweaty and dirty, Several machines out of order, weeks before they get fixed. My daughter got RINGWORM from the child care in her face. After 2-3 weeks then they told me that there was an outbreak. Just a disgusting place. I was brain washed into signing into a personal training session I didn't want or needed. All they did was talk about food, diets, walk around wasting time then they train you for like 10-15 mins ONLY. They charge $50 per session for ONLY 30 MINS which 20 goes to talking crap! I had a medical condition which prevented me from training there. I had 7 remaining training sessions and they REFUSED to refund them to me. Saying I have 1-2 months to use it, when clearly my doctor gave a letter explaining I couldn't use the sessions ANYMORE, PERIOD. SO YEAH...THEY STOLE MY MONEY!THEY CHARGE for membership first and last month and if you want to cancel, you have to write a letter to corporate ONE MONTH in advance so they won't charge you for the next month and use your last month to pay off...so you're obligated to STAY ANOTHER MONTH (BUT THEY SAY IS NOT A CONTRACT) RIGHT? They do not care about you at all. All they want is your money. It's all a scam and disgrace. Don't waste your time in this disgusting place and company. WITH THE MONEY YOU SPEND THERE ANNUALLY YOU CAN BUY A HOME GYM CHEAPER. SAVE YOUR (HEALTH) TIME AND MONEY."
876,864423,2014-11-06,1,"I joined LA Fitness, Henley-on-Thames, UK, earlier this year in April. I joined with a previous friend as it was local to our work and her home. When I signed up, I was shown the facilities and spoke about the use of facilities etc. I was pleased and happy with the amount I would need to pay each month although it was a little expensive for the most basic gym membership. I had the knowledge of when I could attend the gym and classes and that should I need to. I could leave whenever. The whole process was quite pushy, but I signed up anyway. Shortly after I joined, my friendship with my friend crumbled and so did my work in that area, meaning it was difficult for me to attend the gym, let alone pay for it. I called the head office as directed on the website and explained my situation to be responded with a very rude and bored sounding employee stating I couldn't end my 'contract' that I had signed as it was for a year and it wasn't and couldn't be cancelled no matter what. This of course confused me as I wasn't told this when I signed up and I hadn't been using the facilities at all for about a month already. I was annoyed after the phone call but thought nothing of it. I was sent a letter asking me to pay which I also ignored as I hadn't used the gym at all for many months and had contacted the establishment to say why I wasn't attending the gym any more and that I had cancelled my direct debit with them, to which I heard nothing. I then received a phone call saying I had to pay and I explained my situation again and told them I wasn't going to pay for something I haven't used, especially as I had contacted them several times to either freeze or stop the gym without much success. After receiving another letter, I called the head office to complain and another very rude employee told me that its all my fault and that he couldn't do anything about it at all. I explained that I would not be paying as I don't have the money and haven't used the gym for months which they can see from the activity count on my account. They don't care. I don't think this is fair at all as I wasn't explained that the membership was a contract of a year, which you couldn't get out of, unlike other gyms who let you quit after a months notice in writing. Especially with the circumstance I explained to them (which is more than a broken friendship, it involves unemployment and lack of money), they don't care. I am extremely stressed by this and I will be making a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading about them. Don't join this gym if you want to enjoy trying to keep your stress levels down."

My daughter just turned 18 and they sold her this package which now she can't get out for additional 4 months (she already paid 5 months of trainer) just to squeeze her more money. Shame on you for not being transparent & really bad corporate practices which will eventually catch up with this company and their stockholders. Never again!!!!

I called corporate, they put you on hold, they said I have told pay it. I canceled my credit card, they keep on trying to bill me. I wrote to California Attorney General and filed BBB in California. They still have a A+ Rating!! I will keep fighting this battle. Stay away from LA Fitness, it is a rip off!!!! Rick the manager here doesn't give a ** about you.

LA Fitness never processed the cancellation and attempted to collect dues, even though the last month was already paid for.

Instead, unbeknownst to me, I have been charged on my credit card $200 additionally each month for the last 8 months for ""personal training"" services I did not request or ask to pay for. The person who signed me up no longer works at LA Fitness. He was fired for ""unscrupulous conduct."" Based on previous comments from other clients at other LA Fitness gyms around the country, I am concerned I will never see the additional $1600 I have paid. It seems that what happened to me is common practice at this gym. I have spoken to the new manager, **, who has no history with this gym of course, and he said he would need to speak with headquarters in LA before giving me a response. I am waiting for a response, but feel that I have no recourse in this situation. It's my word against a former employee. I will never do business with an LA Fitness gym again."
882,857796,2014-10-23,2,"LA fitness in north palm beach, fl. Recently signed up for a short term. Unlikely to go long term, here is why: place is dirty, especially showers, moldy, smelly, live insects all over the place. The place should be shut down by health department. No toilet paper in the men's room. Many things broken and taped. The worst thing in my view - very loud music, if you can call it music, one can't hear even the phone or radio, announcements like at the railroad station. Request to turn down was ignored or rejected. All in all, very poor impression. Surprised you stay in business like that. My next stop will be Planet Fitness. Last warning - fix it."
883,856112,2014-10-21,1,"This place is terrible for a variety of reasons, but it reached an all-time low this week. Despite being a paying customer for years (I most recently paid a yearly renewal in June), I was pulled out of a yoga class and told--in front of the whole class--that I had to leave because I didn't have a valid membership. I was then told that I had been warned twice about this issue. Both statements were untrue. And needless to say, it was humiliating to be accused of such things in front of a bunch of people. After proving my membership with an email confirmation, I was told that yes, I am a member and should have been issued a new barcode IN JUNE (I have been to the gym many times since June without issue). I told the front desk that I wanted to cancel my membership--no way am I paying $$$ to be humiliated in a room full of people over something I didn't even do--and the girl says they can't do that, I had to call a long distance number (not an 800#) to cancel. So I did that (FYI they have very limited customer service hours). And guess what their response was? Since I had already paid in full, I didn't have to cancel, I could just stop going. When I said I wanted a refund, I got the run around and they said they'd get back to me. Needless to say, they haven't. It's bad enough that machines stay broken for months on end, but when you humiliate a long time customer by accusing them of trying to use the gym when they don't have a membership (and claiming the customer knows that because they've been warned), that crosses a line. This place is unprofessional and poorly managed. It may be cheap, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. Or in my case, you don't even get that because you get thrown out of class for no reason. Oh, and by the way, machines are broken at this place for months on end without repair. And sometimes, they don't even post signs, you figure it out when you try to use it and it goes haywire. This place is just terrible!"

885,852608,2014-10-13,2,"I just recently joined and I did the free assessment. I was interested in training but had to convince my other half. The guy that did my assessment said I could get a trainer twice a month for $90 and he would waive the $150 enrollment fee. My other half wanted to go in and see if he paid an additional year on my gym membership (on top the the 1st and last month, plus enrollment fee he already paid), and the training if he would do it for $1600 cash paid in full. Now the training I was told no fee and 1 year that would come to $1080. The membership for 12 more months would have been $599.40. That totaled $1679.40. Now instead of being honest and just saying I can't do it, he said “let me see what I can do”. So he messed around on the computer and then wrote on a piece of paper what he could give me, instead of 25 sessions he could give 32-34 for $1224. Then he said he could apply my enrollment fee I originally paid as 2 more months which would leave a year being $408 and the total $1632. So we agreed that would be ok and gave him the $1632 cash. He said “ok let’s just get your signature and we’re good”. Now keep in mind all the lies were wrote on paper after he apparently entered the real figures in the computer. He turned the screen so I could see my initials and signature he had to have me sign. Then he printed the document for me to take home. Now he didn't give me a receipt for the gym part but I got that in email. That is when I first noticed the 1st lie. My membership wasn't for a year, only paid me up to June of 2015. He lied about the applying my enrollment. Then I grab my contract and lie number 2! It only shows 25 sessions which was the original amount and not only did he charge me a partial enrollment fee but he also charged me a processing fee which was never mentioned! What makes me mad about all the lies is it wasn't necessary and I love the gym itself but there is no way after what he did will I be able to keep it. My other half will never pay for my continued membership after this! Once what he pays runs out I will have to look elsewhere for a gym and that makes me mad. So way to go trying to get your gym member numbers up the wrong way. Oh and the friend that wanted to come with me to check out the club cause she was interested in training, yeah I will advise her against it! Now I realize I should have read that contract when he handed it to me but at that point he already had my cash and my signature. When he turned the screen for me to see all I could see was the standard writing part where my initials and signature would be required. Not to mention I couldn't have read that from where I sat anyhow. He also only showed the figures that showed the total for the personal training which was the $1224 part and that $0 was due."

Mr. ** stated that because of the billing cycle, I would be charged the September membership fee of $29.99 due on the 8th of each month. However, Mr. ** assured me that my bank account would not be debited for the monthly membership fee for October. Well, LA Fitness DID debit my bank account in the amount of $29.99 anyway!

Mr. Jim ** expressed his ""too bad for you"" sympathies and stated he was the only staff that is authorized to enter member terminations.

I have been working out for over 20 years and never had this kind of treatment at any gym. The Stone Mountain LA Fitness is the worst gym I have ever been to.

My Wife, my nephew and I went to the club on Sept 30th around 8pm and the sales rep gave us a tour and showed the membership options and He said that the guest passes are activated just next day stop by the counter to sign the waiver and use them for the 3 days and hope we get convinced on join the club. Well, we went yesterday October 1st at 6:55pm PST to train and at the counter after checking the passes, they sent us to the sales area for the tour again. I explained that we had the tour yesterday and that we wanted to train and try the gym and for my wife the zumba class. Well the sales guy said ""NO, take a seat""...so we wait for more than 10 min and MAX ** the Sales Rep came to Us. I explained the situation that we wanted to train and try the passes and well after the 3 days we will decide if we stay or not. He wanted to sell the memberships and I told him that I had the prices printed from yesterday. He said, ""NO they are not valid anymore"". OK I understand end of the month, blah blah, he took our ID's and I have a California ID, my nephew too and my wife, because She is in the process of the immigration, she has Her ID from Mexico. Well until we have all settled down, he said ""NO, this is not valid - is not a US ID. I told him well, she is on that process and if we will be signing the waiver we should be OK.. He said NO, NO guests with different type of ID, that I should pay the full membership in order for Her to enter the gym and if I don't like it I can ask the refund in 5 days or only my nephew and I can enter as guests. So I said forget it, how is that possible? He said is the system...and we left the club.How is this possible? I don't see on the Guest pass a note that only US RESIDENTS with a valid US ID can enter the club? Not even on the terms and conditions, an ID from Mexico is valid and the migratory status should not be requested in this cases it's just a fitness club. And How is possible that only PAYING at front for the membership my wife can access the club - bad sales practices. And oh well, with the note that he said, ""if we don't like the club in 5 days I get a refund"" - that's a bad sales tactic, it's not the way to treat future members, it's not the way to treat people. I felt that as a racism because also I have dual citizenship and have my Mexican ID and passport and it's valid as a proof of identity. So if for ignorance He treated Us like that or because He said the system doesn't let me should be said on the guest pass ""SHOULD HAVE VALID US ID"" how do you deal with tourists? Same case.We left the club very disappointing and we were not treated well, how this club is considered ""excellent and how the LA Fitness is proud of the people that work there and have BBB+""?? when they don't treat customers as they should.

I've actually been considering supplementing my jogging in the park routine with a gym package, so went in to redeem the voucher, excited to give this organization a chance. I understood I would probably have to go through some sort of sales pitch, so wasn't terribly surprised when the young woman at the welcome desk directed me to a sales associate. Well, there was pressure from the salesman to sign right then and there, without trying the place out. I was told I wouldn't get their discounted price, which, if I remember correctly, was the initiation fee waived which would be about $100(?) off, unless I signed in the next two days. Well, lower price doesn't mean a darn thing me if I end up paying for something I hate, so I was very clear I would not consider this organization without trying everything out, that I couldn't commit to anything at that point, and even considering a lower price would not get me to sign up that day. I've listened to your spiel, declined, now let me take advantage of the free promotion you sent to my residence. Thanks. I'll let you know. Well he continues, gives me this option: I could fill out paperwork dated Sept. 29th, which would ensure the discounted price. At the same time, this would not be processed until Oct. 5th, the end date of my free trial. Any time before Oct. 5th, I could let him know it wasn't working out for me, and everything would be nixed. Seemed like a harmless enough transaction, and I really wanted to stop the sales part, and try the gym, so I agreed. I watched him as he wrote and circled Oct. 5th, the date I would have until to decide, largely and right at the top of the paper that was just filled out. He told me I'd get the guest pass via e-mail. Well, that worked out well....Nope. I didn't even have an opportunity to use the free pass that was sent to my e-mail, before I get a message the next afternoon. ""Hi Angela. It's **, giving you a call so we can process that agreement. For some reason I couldn't process that info.. Don't know if it was the credit card number or some wrong info.. Call back so we can update and process ASAP."" I was irate and scared (still am)! I called him right back, he denies he was trying to process the agreement. I demanded that he immediately shreds that paperwork. He gives me a, ""will do."" I honest to God feel violated. Couldn't feel worse if he had tried to steal money right out of my wallet. What a corporate thug! I decided to go ahead and use my guest pass, since I had already been through that hassle. Used it that evening, with no problem. I handed over my pass to the front desk it beeped, and I was invited into the gym. Next evening, I handed my pass over to the front desk, it beeped; however I was told at this point they needed an ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE!!! Why!!!! He says because they need to activate my guest pass!!!! You mean the same one I used yesterday without incident. The one that just beeped when you scanned it. You're telling me it is not active!!!! The young man also tells me they need a picture. Why??????!!!! A picture ID, or you want to take a picture?????? I did not stay to find out, left right then. I have a bad feeling they wanted that electronic signature to trick me into a contract. What a waste of my time and energy. All that for 45 min on a treadmill."
895,847069,2014-09-30,1,"I am disappointed that with the new Flagler gym opening, many of the 12th St classes such as step have been eliminated. There were only three step classes a week, Mon and Wed 5:45pm, and Sat. The Mon and Wed class had an excellent instructor; the question is why eliminate those classes. It appears that Zumba and body works will replace these classes. We the students are very unhappy because we are neither Zumba or body works people. Please reconsider acing these classes back on the schedule with Milagros."
896,843474,2014-09-20,1,"The LA Fitness in Chicago on 87th and Cicero is full of unprofessional, arrogant scam artists that will do absolutely ANYTHING to get a buck. It started when the self-proclaimed ""director"" of personal training, ** (turns out he wasn't the director at all), told my sister that he just needed a name on a paper so he could get his bosses off of his **. He told her he would just put down her name, he would pay the initiation fee of $95 - even pulled out his wallet to make it seem as though he was entering his own credit card information. He told her she could then just cancel in a couple of days, no harm no foul. He then follows her to the parking lot trying to pick her up and at some point pulled her cell number from her member file! He signed her up for a YEAR of sessions, charges her LAF account the $95 and when she called him back about it he said he was refunding the money, but didn't. Make no mistake, my sister was CRAZY for falling into this guys scam, but how dirty is he to be preying on young girls with this insanity?! After phone calls to numerous people, I then went in with her to talk to the actual director, at which time he first stood behind the director attempting to intimidate us. She had to ask him several times to walk away, saying that she would handle it. He then sat at his desk and glared at my sister, still trying to intimidate her while we resolved this with the actual director to the point that she and I had to switch seats. My sister is in tears at this point. As we were leaving, I commented to the director that something needed to be done about the way he handled the initial transaction and the way he tried to intimidate us in person and over the phone with a number that he stole from my sister's records. He then proceeds to YELL that we are liars and acts as though he's going to walk over to us. Another staff member at the gym actually had to hold him back! Are you kidding me!? He actually engages my sister in a yelling match in the gym, his place of employment! It was a total JOKE! Avoid 87th and Cicero LAF! This is not over as we will be filing a formal complaint with the corporate offices of LA Fitness and I am headed over the the Better Business Bureau to write a similar review. This is far from over and if you have similar LAF experiences, REPORT THEM!"
897,842651,2014-09-18,1,"I was a member of La fitness for a total of 3 months. I took my daughter in to get her a membership. In the process I talk to an LA Fitness rep about signing her up for the personal training program for my daughter because she had been on crutches for 6 months. They originally told us about a 52 week program. I told them that was longer than we needed and way too expensive. They then told us about a shorter program for 12 weeks. So we agreed. But instead of signing us for the 3 months they sign us up for 52 weeks. When found this out, we went through every channel of their management. We found out that LA Fitness manager meant is not there to help customers. But rather simply there to enforce contracts, even if it means screwing over customers. When I express my displeasure, their top level management only returned my call to inform me that they cancelled both mine and my daughter's membership. I no longer wanted my membership. But my daughter did and was faithfully going and paying fee. She has her account and I have mine. Yet instead of rectifying the situation they chose to cancel both accounts. BE CAREFUL. YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT SIGNING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH. LA FITNESS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING TO YOUR MONEY, NOT GETTING YOU IN SHAPE."
898,842186,2014-09-17,1,"Nice place but I gave my friend's name for a week free trial, she never got it but pressured into signing without trying it out, plus some guy that worked there hanging around the conversation table kind of like he was pressuring the gal that was talking to my friend! This is ridiculous. I don't want the names of my friends pressured. I want them to have the free week then talk membership! I gave them 10 friends' name. This crap better not happen to the rest of my friends! I love the place but do it right! (Springfield IL) Everyone is complaining about this! No one wants to give friend's names anymore!"
899,841327,2014-09-16,1,"I decided to start going to LA Fitness while I was home for summer break because a few friends went there. Because I was only going to be home for three months, my monthly fee was $40 rather than the $29 that they advertise. Fine. So two weeks in I get a text message for a free personal training assessment. I go thinking I'd get a few tips and move on with my life. 15 minutes later I'm sitting at a desk pretty much being forced to get training. I kept telling the girl that I was only going to be there for three months, so I only needed the training for three months. I also kept saying that I wanted to pay my bills cash since the card on file was not mine, rather a borrowed card. What does she do? Have me sign their stupid box for a 52 week contract at $280 a month. This was fine, while I was home for the summer working. Also, half way through summer they 'changed their rules' about paying cash for training and it now had to be on the card. Go figure, like everyone else at LA Fitness the girl I purchased the plan with wound up leaving for another gym. When I found out it was for 52 weeks however, I went nuts. The manager did absolutely nothing and my trainer admitted that I was scammed. When I tried calling asking why I was never informed about their 'new rule' she just said ""oh well they changed it."" I've never even heard of a place turning away cash. Then she had the nerve to tell me ""And why do you want to stop the training."" Gee, I don't know, maybe because you completely lied when you had me sign a contract which I wasn't even informed was a contract. I called headquarters and they politely informed me that I could buy out of my contract for $1,260!!! LA Fitness could not care less about any of their members. The gym is dirty. The sauna never works and according to this site among others I am not the only one who was scammed for personal training. Me as well as all of my friends have left LA Fitness. Like I told all my friends, DO NOT GO HERE!"
900,839759,2014-09-12,1,"I entered the LA Fitness in Hopkins MN today, around 5pm. I have been looking at different fitness facilities in the area (a community center, Lifetime Fitness, YMCA Ridgedale and LA Fitness), and I had been recommended by my partner's mom to check out LA Fitness, due to the low monthly cost around $30. So I walked in the door and was greeted right away by the front desk clerk. He asked me to take a seat and had a sales person come talk with me. I had no idea that learning about their memberships would turn into 45 mins of a sales pitch -- with pressure just like buying a car. After seeing the facility, which was nice and new but crowded and filled with the stereotypical fit, active white American -- which also had a small pool (the sales person compensated this with saying it was very, very clean...), the sales guy sat me down and started the initiation fee at $249, plus $50/month after that -- with first and last month's fees paid up front. A lot of money. That is especially a lot of money for a recent college grad. Then he lowered it. And lowered it again. He said some bogus deals and called three different people to try to get ""the best rate"" for me. It seemed surreal. Then I told him that my partner was interested in joining with me, no matter where we were going to join. And the whole process started over. As someone with anxiety, this whole process was horrid, fake, and scummy. I ran out of there, saying that I really needed to talk to my partner in person. Ick ick ick. STAY AWAY."
901,839608,2014-09-11,4,I like being a member of LA Fitness. The price is right and many of the classes are excellent. The staff keep the club clean. I like being able to attend in whatever part of town I happen to be in on that particular day.

She a tourist. She's visiting and took her there so she can enjoy it. It was worst. The manager say they were not that desperate to allow that she pay $15 for the day only. Who's the desperate here? I think he is because we pay his check. That's a really bad customer service and he went to tell other guys over there about her. What's the big deal? Not every Hispanic is illegal. She come every year to past time and enjoy. She has money and a very good education and that's what these country show to her that white people is racism and low class. She understand what he say because she speak two languages Who's the desperate now, she the one paying and giving money to these country or he the one has a small salary????!!"
903,839127,2014-09-10,1,"I was a member for a year and the person I was joined with decided to cancel. So I decided to rejoin and add my daughter knowing she would be attending college in three months and that my son who was away at school would be returning home. After providing me with all of my options to join, I expressed my desire to transfer my daughter's membership with my son's when she leaves and he returns. The sales rep assured me that I could and would have the same monthly terms. He said to bring my son in to have his picture taken and we would change the names. We went in the other night to make the transfer where I was told that was not possible and given a very hard time and told to call corporate. Of course the employee who promised no longer works there. Calling corporate was extremely frustrating as they basically said I can cancel and start over again paying the $99 initiation fee AGAIN! To get the $25/month/person rate. Or she would credit $50 and I could add my son on for $29.99/month rate. This option would cost me an addt'l $120/year and is not what was promised. There was no additional compromise or resolution for the misinformation I was given. Not a happy customer!"
904,838622,2014-09-09,1,"The ""general manager"" is lazy and shouldn't be selling memberships if he doesn't even work out. He smokes weed outside and thinks people won't know and then hides and sleeps in the building when he's on the clock. A few of the male staff sit around and talk about members and you can hear them cussing from a mile away, they don't realize how badly their voices echo thru parts of the gym. Unless you want to be made fun of and treated poorly I don't suggest being a member here. Worst decision I ever made."
905,838230,2014-09-08,1,"When I went into LA Fitness for the first time, everything looked great and the guy who gave me the tour was very nice. After becoming a member, he told me that I had a free complimentary training session that I agreed to do the next day. After doing a 15 minute workout with the personal training manager, he sat me down and started asking me if personal training was something I wanted to do. I told him it would be nice, but I can't afford a personal trainer, I only have enough money to pay for a basic gym membership, so he kept lowering the prices to get me to agree on something and eventually he went down to 90 dollars a month. I still couldn't afford that, but I have bad anxiety and I easily give in to stress, so just to get him off of my back and to avoid crying over something so trivial, I told him I would agree on it. He said, ""Excellent! Let's just get you to sign a few things."" I asked him if what I was signing was a contract and he said, ""No, no, not at all. This is just to confirm that we will bill to the card you have in our system."" Of course I should have read the actual thing itself, I will never forgive myself for not reading it because it probably would've saved me a huge headache I had later on and also 500 dollars (which will be explained later). So I signed it and he said, ""The first month is absolutely on us, and you can cancel at any time."" Technically, this was true. The first month was free and I could cancel any time I wanted, with a fee. That fee was over 500 dollars, it turns out.I had a couple of training sessions and I realized that it was all bogus. Just because I'm a little big, doesn't mean I don't know a bogus trainer from a real one. The ones I came across felt like they just took those 3-month personal training courses in community college, got ""certified"" and got a job. I felt better working out by myself than with a trainer because I know what I want and I knew what I was doing because I had exercised regularly before in the past.I realized that this wasn't what I wanted and went to go cancel my personal training. I went in and told them I wanted to cancel and they told me I was under a year contract and would have to pay over 500 dollars just to cancel it. I was in absolute shock, I didn't even remember signing a contract. But turns out that thing I signed to confirm that I was going to be billed to my card was actually a contract.I tried telling them that I couldn't afford to pay the contract, but no one would help me. I kept calling customer service lines and speaking with managers, but they refused to help a broke college student like me. Thankfully I had some money left over that I could use (money for school, but what can you do) and went to go pay the fee off. However, before paying the fee, I wanted to see my contract and read it over to make sure that if I pay 500 dollars, they will cancel it forever.When I went in to ask for my contract, the guy at the front desk said, ""Huh. For some reason it won't let me print out your contract..."" Fishy, right? Then I told him I just wanted to pay off the fee for my personal training contract, but not until I receive my contract. He clicked some things on the computer and then he told me there was a system error and that I should come back in the morning.When I came home I noticed 540 dollars was billed to my account from LA fitness. Surprise! He charged my card without asking me and I didn't receive an email confirmation. I came storming in the next morning asking them why I was billed 540 dollars and not told anything about it. They told me it was just an error, and that the money was cancelled on their end and my bank would return the pending transaction back to me. They tried to reassure me that money would not be taken off my account, and asked me if I wanted to pay the fee for real this time, with a receipt and everything. At this point I was crying and stressed out and I just wanted them to stop screwing me over. I paid for the fee, nulling my contract, and now I am just waiting for the bank to return that 540 dollars pending on my account.It has been a very stressful situation for me in LA Fitness and I would never, ever recommend anyone ever taking their money there because the moment they see you walk in, you are just a walking pile of cash, not a human being. Even the front desk people there understand that people get ripped off all the time. LA Fitness is an awful company and if you love yourself, do not go in there and do not sign up for anything. Do yourself a favor and just go to a cheaper gym where people leave you alone and don't pressure you to sign up for things, or just buy yourself a set of weights and get creative."

So I assumed that it checked me in. Come to find out the next month that it was not processed and I did not go the gym 1 day that month so I will not receive my ins. reimbursement. I called and spoke to Operations Manager named NICK and he said he cannot do anything about it. I know it's only $20, but it's the principal of the matter. This is obviously LA Fitness check-in error and they should credit my account for $20 because it's their fault. Very unhappy.."
907,834217,2014-08-29,1,"I was also put on a training contract for 1 year I was completely unaware of. First day I came in, they offer me a personal trainer which I was not in the position to pay. Never the less, they offered me to try it for a month, and if after that I decided not to continue, I could just tell them. They offered me a deal (not that much of a deal) and I went ahead and tried the month with the personal trainer. I sat in the office while they were filling out on the computer my information, gave them my credit card to pay for the first month plus the admission fee. Quite expensive by the way. And signed electronically on a screen box, as they asked me to, never having a document to see what I was signing. Stupid of me, I know! They never gave me a contract or anything; afterwards, he told me he will e-mail me the contract. Which I never read, anyway, thinking it was about my admission and one month of personal trainer. After a month, I spoke with the guy, **, to let him know I had decided not to continue with the personal trainer. He told me he was sorry - it had being five weeks already and I should have told him a week before. Then he told me that I had signed in for a full year contract and I had to continue! I was very upset but after a long conversation with him, thought I had no choice, so I had to continue. After 5 months, they call me today from California, (I am in Miami) to tell me that this month, they have not being able to charge the monthly fee to my account. I was at a meeting, so I asked them to call me back in a couple of hours. In the next hour, I received four calls from different offices. Again I explained I already talk to someone and I was in a meeting. They did not care; the guy said he could take care of my issue right now. Again, I explained I was at a meeting. He continue talking not giving a ** about my meeting, so I had to hang up and put my phone in silence. Calls continue to come in every 15 minutes from different numbers. In between my meetings, I finally got a chance to talk to one of them. Turns out they made a mistake with the info on my credit card. My card as I explained had not being changed and enough funds were in the account. What happened was, they had written the wrong billing address. So, I gave the right address to the lady. Even though they had the right information from the beginning, and they had being charging all this months with no problem at all. Why they made the mistake, I have no idea. They are so desperate to get your money that, I assume my bank blocked them after many wrong attempts. She asked me to call my bank and fix it right away. Since I still was busy with my day, I told her I could go to my bank on Monday and try to see what happened. Still, they continue calling me throughout the day, between 10 and 15 calls. Interrupting me from my work and everything else I had to do this day. Total harassment! And again, asking for my card info. Which I had already given earlier to this woman. By this time I was really furious. The last calls were from the local LA Fitness at Coral Way Miami, where I go. I explained my conversation earlier with the lady and that I had tell her I would go to my bank on Monday after giving her again my CC information. After all, it was their mistake, not mine, and it is not like my life is all about LA Fitness! So, very rude they tell me they will put me on the list! What list? I asked. On the list that you cannot pay!!!! What? So, I ask for **, as furious as I am with this rude and lying guy. He gets on the phone and immediately, I ask him what the hell is wrong with all of them, if they are subnormal or what! Calling me the whole day when I have already told the lady whom first called me, I will fix it for them on Monday. So, ** tells me that there are 600 establishments from LA Fitness throughout the US, and they are all going to call me until I fix it. If this is not a threat and harassment, I don´t know what else is. I want to get out of this contract that they pulled in the first place out of me, in a fraudulent way. I hate this gym, the worst I have ever seen, the worst treatment to their clients and a total rip off! Total SCAM! HATE THEM!"

912,830728,2014-08-20,1,"I am beyond annoyed at the guy who is in charge of personal training at the location I attend. I worked in a school, and at the end of this past school year they eliminated the position I was working in so that they did not have to offer us benefits next year. At this time I had been doing personal training for over a year and a half (I had signed a year contract, so that was not an issue) and knew that since it was the summer and I had no promise of a job in the fall I needed every penny I could get. So July 2nd after my workout I saw that the guy, Brian, in charge of personal training was free and went over to explain the situation to him. He had me sit down took my information and had me sign a written up piece of paper and told me he would call me later that night when it was confirmed. But he assured me that the July 6th payment would be the last. Never got a phone call. My fault I never called him but then I did not check my bank account again until August 5th when I saw the July 6th personal training, July 16, and August 2 all taken from my account. I, now am running low on funds, needed that $300 for insurance and what not, am mad but go to the gym and ask to speak to someone. I am told at the front desk again that Brian is currently busy and if I sign another written up paper he will take care of it when he is finished. It is now August 20th and yet another payment has been taken from my account!!!! I went in today and they PRINT out a paper for me to send to CA to confirm the cancellation. WHY was I not given this paper over a month ago? WHY is this all of a sudden popping up as an option? And how do I know that this paper is mysteriously not going to make it to CA from NJ before yet another payment is taken from my account!!!!? I refuse to use the 37 sessions I ""paid"" for, 8 of them being from this summer. But I know there is no way to get the over $3000 back, that could really help right now. Beyond annoyed!!!

914,829613,2014-08-18,1,"I went in with my fiance to get a family membership. We talked with a young women for awhile, but we found it was a little more than we wanted to pay, so we were about to leave and think about it. The sales manager came over for the hard sell and we stayed thinking we could probably get the price down. He started writing numbers down and would change those numbers over and over, as well as the membership. Then he started in about if we got a fourth person to join, it would be even less. We are a family of three, so I don't know where we are supposed to find this fourth person. Again, he was changing numbers and said we could join for $100 today and worked out a deal for the rest to be paid in a month. I said ok and handed over my card. The girl swiped it. Then the manager changed the story, told the girl to go ahead and charge the remaining amount. I demanded my card back and said I was leaving, cancel the transaction (I have signed nothing at this point). He told the girl not to give me my card back and kept talking. Now he was getting aggressive. He told me not to leave and to sit down. Again I demanded my card back and again he told the girl not to give it back. Finally she gave it back and said the charge was canceled. He said it couldn't be canceled and I should just pay the remainder. I just left. I will dispute the charge, which was not canceled with the credit card company as I never signed a thing. I know it's their job to ""hard sell"" a membership, but this was ridiculous! The sales manager was yelling at me and he is a very large intimidating man. If they gave me a free lifetime membership, I'd never go in there again because of the way I was treated. There are plenty of other gyms nearby. I was going to call someone above him to discuss this, but LA Fitness doesn't give you that option. The only phone I can get is for that one location and I have no intention of talking to anyone there."

Not great, but fair enough, business have to make sure they collect their dues. I had this immediately fixed and thought it was the end of the issue. Not so. It transpired that the new details were not transferred across to take care of my personal training sessions and on Monday June 23rd I received almost 25 calls and 25 voicemails from the collections department. I answered the first call, and said that I would sort it out when I went to the club that evening. Nothing was put on my account to this effect and I continued to be bombarded with calls and voicemails throughout the day. When I went to the club after work I explained the situation to the manager who was not very sympathetic to my case and said it was out-with her control. I said to her that I wanted somebody to take responsibility for the way I had been dealt with, to which she said she would put a note on my account and somebody would be in touch from corporate to discuss. Nobody called. June 27th, I emailed customer services explaining the situation, asking for a customer service representative to call me. July 26th - Email to customer services: ""Nobody has been in touch to discuss this. Can you follow up on the status of my complaint please?"" July 22nd - Email to customer services - ""Can you please advise on this?"" I spoke to Jacky at Eldridge this week, she was meant to call me back with an update and hasn't done so. I'm upset with LA Fitness and the increasing lack of communication, so much so it's affecting my progress and I feel unable to carry on the way things are. If I don't get a response within the next two days I will be getting in touch with the Better Business Bureau and filing a complaint, and also suspending my payments until this has been resolved. July 23rd, call from Corporate to apologize and offer me 1 month free membership (membership, not PT dues). They promised to call me back to let me know what had gone wrong with their process, as I said I did not want this happening to anyone else, and wanted to see that something had been done about it. They never called me back.August 3rd, moved to a different location partly because I have moved house and it's more convenient, partly because I want to put the problems with LA Fitness behind me and start fresh. Realize that Eldridge had signed me up to a Master Trainer agreement, without telling me that there were two different levels of trainers to choose from. My new club (Katy) has 1 master trainer that only works during the day, and I struggle to get to him on time after work. Asked him for my measurements to be taken so I can chart progress, this does not happen and we begin my workout. I speak to a guy at the desk to ask him about my PT in general (measurements, master trainer vs regular trainer) and he tells me to call Bryson the PT Manager to discuss, telling me Bryson looks after his customers.August 4th, I call and leave a message for Bryson to call me back he does not. August 11th, call and speak to Bryson. Asked him about the master trainer situation, and he says that my only option is to go with a regular trainer but continue to pay for a master trainer. Half way through me speaking I hear hold music. A bit odd, however, I hang up and straightaway call again. Reception advise that Bryson is now on a conference call. Ask him to call me back, he did not. I call corporate and get cut off twice whilst explaining my situation. I asked for a call back from the second representative who said he would if we got cut off. We did get cut off and no call came.I patiently called for the third time and spoke to Melissa. She advised there was nothing she could do about the situation. I asked to speak to her manager and she told me she was the manager and that there was nobody above her to talk to. LA Fitness have left me feeling so frustrated. Their business practices are unethical, and all they want is to take your money. I faced harassment the day I received all those calls, and it left me feeling genuinely upset. The Personal Training is definitely not a holistic service - it's 25 minutes of coaching from a trainer. I could do this myself! No consideration into tracking progress or your wider lifestyle. All in all, probably the worst organization that I've ever had to deal with."
916,822908,2014-08-02,1,"I was a member of LA Fitness for a long time. 7-30-14 I was yelled at by yoga instructor in front of other 20 people in room. During the class she yelled that 'I must leave the room now' because I was talking with friend next to me. Never the less, I just said a few words and even had no chance to finish my sentence before yoga instructor started yell on me. I felt that I have been assaulted and humiliated. Management was not helpful and understanding at all. Zero customer service skills. I had no choice but canceled my membership."
917,820661,2014-07-29,1,"I have written and called to request cancellation of my membership, and after being told that it would be taken care of, they are still taking the money from my checking account!! I am so disappointed not only with this, but with the way they treated me the last time I showed up with my son to work out. I was told that if I purchased a certain membership type, I could add 3 people to my ""VIP list"" and these people could come to the gym as my guests. The first and only time I brought a guest, my son, I was told he would have to pay $15 to use the gym. We left. I have never returned. I was so hurt and embarrassed. That was June 20. I sent a letter that day, and they continue to bill me. I am contacting my attorney today."
918,820178,2014-07-28,1,"I joined LA Fitness as a member just over a year ago. Due to a family situation at home, I have used the membership maybe twice in the past year. Between working full time, providing care for my father, school, and spending the remaining time running my dad back and forth to dr. visits. I attempted to cancel my membership online. I was under the impression that I would no longer be charged for a service I was not using anymore, lo and behold LA Fitness continued to charge my bank account for the next 4 months. My quick fix to this? I canceled my bank card and reported it stolen. Now La Fitness reps from all over the United States are calling me to notify me that my account is delinquent. I have spoken to a rep at the corporate office to sort the matter out. I was told that I had to go into a local establishment to cancel in person, or submit written notice for my account to be closed, as they do not allow their customers to cancel via the internet. I explained the situation to the Corporate Rep, as due to my current life circumstance I have not had the time to use my membership in nearly a YEAR - she seemed understanding and stated she would email me the necessary documents to mail off in order for my account to be canceled. I told the associate I would take care of the paperwork and mail it off.I HAVE NEVER received anything from LA FItness since my phone conversation with this associate. Before I even had a chance to follow the ""procedure"" I continued to receive phone calls from La Fitness studios across the United States. I am being harassed for a service I paid for and never got to use. This is ridiculous. This business is a scam, a waste of money, and their ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" skills are terrible! Save yourself the trouble and hassle if you are looking into a membership. Find another facility. Another Dissatisfied Customer"
919,819373,2014-07-25,1,"I have charged for $200 extra amount event though I cancelled my membership. Operations Manager is very rude and never in favor of customers and just looks for payment. Funny part is, they charge double during first month and it is automatically applied for an extra month after cancellation. The best of the worst."
920,817985,2014-07-22,1,"Same thing happened to me exactly as others have posted. My membership when with Jack Lalanne always renewed for 3 yrs and then La Fitness took over and I never got a renewal notice. I went to my local gym and questioned why and they said they called me on ""PHONE"" and I never got any message. I know they never did. They revoked my membership. I called Corporate office and they said there was nothing they could do for me as the membership lapsed. I agree this is all a BIG scam as Jack Lalanne lifetime members like me had such low annual renewals they wanted us out. Obviously they don't care about anyone's health interest but rather the best interest of their wallets. And conveniently ""they don't send out mailings"" I wonder why? Cause if they did we would have renewed and then they couldn't revoke all our memberships! Stinks!! Someone needs to put them straight!!"
921,817968,2014-07-22,1,I was put on a training contract for 1 year I was completely unaware about. The company is now forcing me to pay an outrageous amount of money just to cancel the contract and as well as charging unethical amounts of money to my credit card.
922,817801,2014-07-22,1,"The male staff who was trying to convince me to sign up on the spot, even without giving me a chance to try out their services, held my driver's license ""hostage"" and told me that it is their rule to hold on to the customer's ID and return it after the workout. I consented to that even if I felt worried it might get lost. I should have given in to my intuition because lo and behold! After my workout, the male staff was nowhere to be found and he even did not leave my DL to anybody there! I was so stressed and pissed at the same time! How can a staff be that irresponsible to handle a very important document like that???!!! Turned out that the DL was under the keyboard at the front desk, without the Receptionist knowing about it! Talk about efficient service! They could not even present their Manager so I can directly explain the situation to him. I will not be surprised if this gym will be closed in no time at all... Really a bad experience... Will surely spread this experience to all my friends to warn them... Better to just work out at home than to spend hard earned money on this crappy fitness place.... Sorry no stars..."
923,816795,2014-07-20,2,"It's so sad a company like LA fitness has the worst gym and assistant managers all over Canada since I am in gym locations since 7 years. Most of their assistant managers are not even 24 years old... a lack of experience and etiquette... don't even know how to talk with a customer... very misbehaved and intimidating. If you ask them something they turn their head and walk somewhere else - no politeness, no respect for the business. As a customer it's so unfortunate and hurting that I have to deal with this and while pay money I cannot cancel my membership on spot, where as there is no contract with them. LA the worst gym ever I have found (even most of their machines are almost broken) in my seven years of gym experience. (Very uncomfortable to deal with)."
924,815824,2014-07-17,1,I had a bad experience with LA Fitness training program. The personal training staff set me and myself under same account. They said with current specials going on we can pay for one and both can get trained. After two months they are saying we need to open a different account and pay initiation fee and training fee which doubles what we are paying currently. What to do?
925,815447,2014-07-17,1,"I joined Bally's in 2000 and have been paying renewal dues for years which they automatically deducted from my bank account and it has never been a problem so I never monitored it. A few weeks ago I noticed that they stopped charging my bank account so I contacted my local gym (Montebello, CA) and was told that they tried contacting me by PHONE but couldn't reach me and my account was now revoked/denied and I had to purchase a new membership. I was transferred to sales to told me their ""deals"" which are NOT deals. I then contacted the corporate office and was told the same thing, they attempted to contact me by phone. I informed him that # had not been used in years and asked which address they sent a written notification to as my address has not changed and he said ""Oh we don't mail notifications"" then he asked if I had an email and read me the one on file which is not mine, nor has it ever been registered to me. He then put me on hold to talk to a supervisor then came back and said ""sorry, there's nothing we can do. You need to purchase a new membership."" I emailed the corporate office informing them that my membership was revoked without notifying me and that if a notification would have been mailed to me, I would have contacted the office immediately to provide updated billing info. I have yet to hear back from them. Horrible customer service and dirty way of getting rid of Bally members with low monthly payments. ***side note: I was never notified in person because I had stopped going to the gym for a few months...****"
926,809804,2014-07-03,1,"LA Fitness should be investigated by the Better Business Bureau for not allowing their customers to cancel. I called and had to have my membership canceled on Friday, June 27, 2014. I received notice yesterday, June 29, 2014 that $32.46 was illegally taken out of my account for LA Fitness membership dues. No money should have been taken out of my account because at joining I paid first and last month's membership dues. I canceled before the renewal on the 28th and would like the amount of $32.46 refunded to my account immediately. This all comes on the heels of what has been a complete disaster of customer service on the end of the corporate division of LA Fitness and also at your local clubs. I originally contacted your corporate office to cancel my membership. I was told that I could not cancel over the phone and I would have to go into a club to cancel my membership, (which is completely false and inaccurate information as I did cancel my membership over the phone on June 27th). So I did go into a club and attempt to cancel my membership... TWICE. The first time I was told there was nobody there that could cancel my membership and that I would need to come back. So I did. The second time I attempted to cancel my membership, I was given the exact same speech from the front desk personnel on June 27th at your Lewisville, TX location that there was nobody in the office that could cancel my membership. I told the person at the front desk that this was my second attempt to cancel my membership and it was the 2nd time that I was given the same speech. I knew my membership was going to renew on the 28th, the next day and that it needed to be canceled that day to avoid another membership monthly due. He said he could not help me at all and told me that I needed to drive 10 miles out of my way to go to another club to cancel my membership. My frustration grew when I asked him if I wanted to sign up for a new membership, if there was plenty of staff at that location to assist me, and your employee clearly stated that there was. Finally, I asked for LA Fitness corporate office and sat at your Lewisville location and called the corporate office AGAIN, and explained to the representative on the other end of the phone that I had tried to call before and cancel, had walked into two separate locations to cancel and was told nobody could assist me and that I was not going to drive 10 miles out of my way to attempt to cancel again. The person on the phone was very helpful and immediately canceled my membership.This experience is not an exception to the way your company treats membership cancellation. My boyfriend is experiencing the exact same issues when attempting to cancel his membership. He called to cancel, was told he had to come in. Every time he attempted to cancel at your club locations, nobody was in the office to cancel his membership.LA Fitness' response was only, ""We understand your frustration and a refund has been issued"". Shame on you LA Fitness. You manipulate your members, you always say you can't cancel over the phone, BUT in fact you DO, but when we try to follow the guidelines and cancel in club, no one EVER is available to do that.Members, I implore you to file a Better Business Bureau complaint if you have experienced the same issues. Companies should not be allowed to entrap you, month after month. It's your money and you are legally allowed to stop membership at any time."
927,809119,2014-07-01,1,"I added my Mom to my plan during the promotion that waived membership fees. A couple months later I got a new debit card and LA Fitness contacted me to update it. My Mom had told me she already gave them her card, so I asked them why I was being contacted if her card was already on file. She informed me that even though we were on the same plan our payments were separate, and she couldn't see my Mom's card info or access her account. I then gave her my card number and she said I would only be responsible for my own payments of $29.99 each month, and my Mom would take care of hers. I thought it was great and we were good. I later saw my account was charged $34 (even though membership is normally $29?) but shrugged it off, assuming it would go back to normal next payment cycle. Fast forward a few months later to today, July 1 2014. Because I am currently on a tight budget, I checked my account to make sure no unnecessary expenses occurred and lo and behold I see at the top of my account activity 2 charges of $29.99. I then check past transactions, and realize I completely missed other double charges dating back to May, when the payments were supposed to be just $29.99. It is my fault for not realizing until a few months later, but now that I do realize this I am very angry. I called LA Fitness and they did not care at all, went right into a ""moving forward"" plan, and said I might as well have my Mom pay me back than wait for them to refund the money. There was actually NO record of my Mom's card in their system, and the lady who I spoke to who took my card number, and I am having her check her card statements tonight. I cancelled my card. They are not taking any more of my money."
928,807422,2014-06-27,1,I do not have a membership contract with you. Stop bugging me for dues and threatening me with collection. I will sue LA Fitness if I get one more email from them.

929,805210,2014-06-23,1,"Several years ago, I signed an agreement with LA Fitness. It was written that upon my college kids' visits into town, they could attend LA Fitness without my being present. It has been a struggle to get LA Fitness to honor the agreement. Until recently, they have honor it with much angst. Recently, they explained it was not a standard agreement and that they refuse to honor it. They stated there was no discussion and would terminate my agreement unless I pay twice as much ($60 monthly). Needless to say, I terminated and moved my membership to a nicer facility that saved me from the standard cost of $480 a month to $185. The facility is equal with the pool being far superior, and more importantly, people are respectful and nice."

I received a phone call from Michelle from LA fitness on Grant Avenue, Philadelphia. She told me since I have been distributing flyers for nutritional cleansing in women's locker room, she believes I am a threat to the company and we should part our ways. First, I was not aware of no solicitation rule since I constantly see advisement of various products and events in women's locker room. Also, there are advertisements for various local business openly displayed in the lobby. I was told by Michelle that these businesses do not compete with their product which I assume fitness. I didn't think that healthy and clean eating. I have been doing both for a while. The issue I have with this occurrence is the way it was handled. I was not given a warning or a choice to apologize for my innocent actions. My membership was automatically cancelled even though it was pre paid for 3 years. I believe this incident was not professionally addressed and I am very upset. Since I joined the LA Fitness, I have brought many friends and family to join LA Fitness. I will make sure that all my friends would find out how I was treated by LA Fitness. By canceling my membership without giving me a choice, LA Fitness pushing me in direction of their direct competitor, other local fitness centers.

931,799089,2014-06-06,1,"I came to LA Fitness after the last gym I attended had ""kicked out"" my friends as members. It was just a silly situation. Anyway, I was impressed with the two-week free trial. I came to try it out and was hounded right off the bat. This one person flirted, talked to, and harassed me for about two hours. When I finally tried the gym, I did love it and thought I would join. I signed up for the gym. Month-to-month payment was pretty reasonable in comparison to other gyms. Then, I was bullied (I'd say) to sign up for a personal trainer. I had expressed interest and knew it would cost money. I discussed the overall expense with them and figured it was a pretty good deal once they knocked down the price. I left happy. On my way home from the gym, the person I had signed up with called me. I had not personally given him my number. He stated he had gotten it from my account. Then he asked to come to my house, and flirted saying he was interested in me. I declined, but was really creeped out how he had gotten my number and contacted me.When I signed up, I initially paid over three hundred dollars for a twenty-eight week program. This wasn't including my month-to-month membership fee. That's what I deemed reasonable. They kept pushing me to sign up that day as they could only lock in that rate that day. That it would go up tomorrow. I should have taken that and the call as my sign to back out. I received a call days later from the corporate office stating I was hereby required to make monthly payments of 240 dollars that would be deducted from my account. This wasn't discussed with me when I was rushed through the contract. I even specifically asked about other fees and charges. Then when I went into talk to the same guy I dealt with, that was calling me to flirt, he assured me no other charges would come out of my account. I told him his corporate office called to tell me about the contract I signed. This guy assured me. He promised nothing else was being charged. Now I've had to pay out 50% of the rest of the charges. I've paid over $1000 for a service that I thought was a third of the price. And I'm not interested in signing up for a gym ever again. Thanks LA Fitness."

They are too unreliable and unresponsive to complaints."

When we came back the following Monday we were told that the person we needed to see was on vacation and we would have to come back next month. So they could charge us another month. When we came back a week later which was another month that we were billed for, we waited for another hour in the front office. Then we were told to fill out the paperwork and submit it via mail. This company is a total rip off."
934,791227,2014-05-30,1,"I have been a member of LA fitness for 4 years, but will be quitting based on their poor record in hiring and maintaining qualified instructors. The group fitness classes are an important part of many members, and their behavior towards instructors speaks of how little they are concerned with having the most qualified instructors. Based on a single incident that was of little consequence to anyone, my local gym recently fired the instructor who was once a fitness regional manager for them with a huge following of members who took classes with her. Due to the fact she was so highly qualified and was paid somewhat better than the usual instructors who do not have a degree in fitness and do not keep their training and certification current, the corporate manager did not follow the recommendation from the local fitness manager for a simple reprimand and abruptly fired her. The consequence of this action will be seen in resignation of membership and negative recommendations from these members. These actions should make you aware of what this corporation really cares about."

I just wondering if they are open to use the same tactic to enroll with them. Then that same guy told me that the second option is to print out the cancellation form, which I tried several tines online (impossible), and he told me they didn't have paper to print. Then he called a guy at the other gym located at 56th Street and 137th Avenue in Miami, a guy named ** to go there and this other guy is going to help me out with the cancellation process. I went there and a very rude, disrespectful ** told me that he can't do anything without his supervisor and I have to come back from Monday to Friday - same old. I decided to go back to the previous gym with my own paper and let them print out the form. The guy at first told me that because they were out of paper, the printer printed out other forms first. Trying to be cool, I told him to please print it on any used paper, which he did, after more than one hour if struggling."
936,786915,2014-05-16,1,"I went to LA fitness just ask question about new facility. With lots of pressure and so many promises that one special trainer will work with me and make me strong and healthy, they sold me the membership and one year personal training for two times a week. When he were signing me, I told him that I just want TWO months to see how my body will do with exercising. Since I wanted just two months I did not pay initiation fee of almost one hundred dollars. Then my husband joined and he paid initiation fee and he pays much less than I. LA fitness offered a promotion that you can add a family member to your membership and do not pay initiation fee and pay $29.99 per month. I called and asked them to add me to his membership. At first they promise to do, but now almost after three months I talked to one of the manager and he said they can not add me to his and I have to pay almost 35.00 dollars each month since at beginning I did not pay initiation fee. Now even they do not honor their own promotion. I really felt at the beginning lots of pressure to buy and I just wanted two month, but the way their contract is you just sign for a year and he did not tell me. I feel he deceive me. Their organization is very bad managing. I am very unhappy and angry. Please help, thanks."

The first year, they refused to let me in and I had to call the Better Business Bureau on them and they added an extra week to my membership. The second year, they said that my check didn't go through when they processed it, and said that my bank refused my check which is a lie. But my bank had no record of them depositing it. Now the third year, they are playing the same game and have not cashed the check saying it didn't go through. I have gone to LA Fitness twice and had to show them the receipt that showed I paid. Now the Jacuzzi has been broken for over five months at 7640 W. Thomas in Phoenix, AZ 85033. Why can't they provide better service to its customers?"
938,784290,2014-05-08,2,"My husband and I went to join the gym in Jan 2014 (only because it was the closest to our home). I already had a 24-hr fitness membership which I was completely happy with. Had to cancel because it was too far from me. Anyways to make a long story short, we only signed up for the regular month-to-month gym membership. The associate ""MIGUEL"" from LA FITNESS, FONTANA, CA kept on insisting and giving us so many reasons to get us to get a personal trainer and he wasn't doing in a way that was motivating. Actually he was coming off so rude that it made us feel so uncomfortable and made us feel horrible about ourselves, as if we didn't feel ""fat enough"" already. Miguel, offered my husband a few free training sessions and said and I quote ""Let me give you a few training sessions to try it out and if you don't like it, you don't have to pay. I will train you myself."" My husband agreed to that. He shows up the next day and before the session even started, he made him initial and sign ""electronically"" by saying that they were necessary due to ""liability"" reasons for the training sessions. No questions asked, my husband signed. He didn't get a copy of the contract, nothing. He only had that 1 session and ""Miguel"" didn't train him as he promised. He handed my husband to someone else. Needless to say my husband did not like that and he only had that session and decided not to continue.3 months later, my husband checks his account and and on top of the membership fee, the gym had been deducting $140 every month. He goes to the gym and they told him he signed up for a 52-week (12-month) training agreement at $35 a week ($140 per month) and he wanted to cancel he had to pay 50% of the remaining contract totaling $560. My husband was in complete SHOCK! He tried to explain the situation to the manager and what had happened and what Miguel told him, etc. The manager just said he couldn't do nothing for him and directed him to call LA Fitness corp. WOW, they can't do ""nothing""? Not even try to discuss it with the person who signed him up, see what his explanation was to completely DECEIVING the member? My husband called the LA Fitness and he was told the same thing, pay up $560 and you can cancel. Otherwise, the monthly charges would continue.He signed for something under 'FALSE MISREPRESENTATION'. He wasn't even told that he was signing up for a training agreement, the cost, the terms, nothing. After looking at other reviews about LA Fitness and searching the web, I find out that this is NOT an isolated incident. Many people have been scammed into signing up for contracts and were not told what they were signing up for. The gym associate only verbally tells them and member signs electronically. And we are supposed to trust the gym associate? How many more people will be scammed before someone puts a stop to LA FITNESS' UNFAIR, UNETHICAL PRACTICES!!!!!"

Today I figure out the $10 charges monthly. I went back to Lisa today. Her coworker said maybe Lisa said it wrong at that time. I said, ""Okay, please help to cancel the membership."" Then Lisa became too rude for me. What she said made me uncomfortable even feel discrimination. I call the LA Fitness headquarters already. She cannot regard people by members.

I was on a month-to-month deal, but one month I was having financial difficulty and could put my account on hold for $10. Well, the next month I get charged $10 PLUS the regular monthly charge of $29.99!!! Do not give them your checking account number. Trying to reverse the charges are a nightmare. They act like the customer is the problem. I have never dealt with such bad customer service in my life. My bank Wells Fargo had to get involved and put the money back into my account, and I had to call the corporate office of LA Fitness (949) 255-8100 three times to finally get this issue resolved (ask for Soazig or Chris). I cancelled both mine and my wife's accounts, and we're going to tell everyone we know not to join."

Very low class employees and managements.... LET alone the level of dirtiness and low class crowd that LA Fitness is attracting recently.... In few words, LA fitness used to be a great gym and now nothing but a slum.... Glad I went to Life Time where they treat their members as person and not a number..."

Called the Holmdel facility and got the account manager who then informed me that my account could not be put on freeze and he didn't know why. I can't afford the extra expense at this time and had to cancel my account. If I would have known that in first place I would not have joined the establishment.

When I tried to mediate, I was treated like they could care less about me and that I was basically **. I am appalled to my very core at the way this company conducts business, and from what I've read in the thousands of similar complaints, this is not the first time they have pulled this scam!! The same thing has happened to many others (class action lawsuit anyone?). I was scammed by this evil and unethical company. LA Fitness is the devil."

She was doing the FULL workout alongside me. LA Fitness does not give you the written contract, so one would never know this ""rule"".

I have tried to cancel online, which you can't, called corporate, who said you have to go the location. I went to the location 2 times and they say you have to speak to a manager. I went 2 weeks ago and must have found someone who was nice and they looked up my membership and said, ""Okay, you are canceled."" Today I see they are still charging my card. I call and now they tell me you have to mail the form they gave me. I speak to a manager and he says his operations manager can get it canceled on Monday. When I signed up didn't have to mail anything, call anyone or speak to 6 or 7 people. They make it impossible to cancel. What a scam.."
950,765023,2014-03-07,1,"When attempting to cancel a membership at LA Fitness that I was paying for on behalf of my mother, my mother went to the front desk and told them she wanted to cancel her membership. They said she needed to speak with a supervisor who apparently wasn't there at the time. She said she would come back and later when she went back, the supervisor was magically not there again. My mother said, ""is there no other way to cancel my membership."" The front desk gave her a form to sign and mail in, which she did. They told her that was it, she was canceled. Except for an additional 12 months, my credit card was hit with charges. While I didn't notice the charges because it is an expense account that I don't review on a monthly basis, I did eventually see that I was still being charged. When I called them to discuss this issue, they first told me I needed to speak with a supervisor.....guess what...he wasn't there. When I finally got him on the phone, he indicated he would call me back after he looked into it......guess what....he did not. So I called corporate.....and they told me they have no proof that my mom filled out the form. Perhaps she changed her mind and wanted to keep her membership even though she never stepped foot in the gym again. Did she certify the letter she mailed? really....certified mail. How about no one on their end processed the cancellation form and they continued to charge me for almost a year. They said they would be generous and credit me 2 months payment. After hours of argument they finally agreed to give me 6 months credit, but at the time I am writing this they only processed 4 months. When I called them and asked them for proof or verification that they were going to refund me the 6 months, they told me they cannot do that. So they want you to certify mail their cancellation, but they will not send you an email with what they promise. LA Fitness in my opinion is a huge ripoff. If you want to cancel your membership there, I would check and recheck and verify and re verify that you are not getting charged. if you expect a phone call back forget it. The entire organization is brainwashed into taking peoples money and not providing anything to them in return. If you are even considering a membership at LA Fitness, i would strongly suggest going elsewhere. I know there are no longer small gyms around, but if you find one support them. Stop going to the big box membership gyms that are run like by a bunch of corporate thieves."
951,764779,2014-03-07,1,"This is about the LA Fitness in California, Garden Grove location at Valley View and Chapman Street. The manager named ** came in to the saunas and accused me of using the paper towel too much and she had already given me lots of warnings. I was surprised and shock of the accusation since this is the first time I saw her face. I asked her if she is sure it's me. She called the cleaning lady in and said it is me. I said, ""I never did that and I have not have any warning whatsoever."" I said if she continue to accuse me I will talk to my lawyer. Before I leave I asked her to write down her name and phone number. She asked for my membership card and said she is going to revoke my membership right now. She called another guy manager over and they both said the same thing. I asked for both their names and phone numbers, the girl write down her name (**) and the guy write only his first name (**). I asked for their phone numbers and their boss phone numbers, they said I should look it up myself. This is a true harassment and discrimination case. I will continue to call the headquarters until I got a decent answer as to why these people have the right to pick on any customer to harass without any evidence whatsoever. I paid to come work out with relax and respectful environment, instead LA Fitness managers made me feel humiliated and disrespectful. LA Fitness has too many bad managers, I feel like the club is being run by the mob. Let our voices be heard, justice will prevail."
952,764713,2014-03-07,2,"Are monopolies ever a good thing? Well after LA Fitness has virtually cornered the market in the metropolitan Detroit area as it pertains to a full service health club with multiple locations; I am going to respond absolutely not! After disputing a manager at the Allen Park, Michigan location in January of 2012 in regards to taking an ID picture or showing state identification - as stated in the contract - I turned to the corporate office to assist with this seemingly easy to resolve issue. Their response, was merely to give away personal services I did not seek. I was not contacted by anyone - unless I initiated the call. Feeling very unappreciated, my membership was cancelled as a well as full monetary fees returned to my person. Well two years later, and fewer and fewer Health clubs with all the amenities such as a pool, varying work out options and multiple locations; I foolishly made contact with this corporate giant, to rejoin. Unbeknownst to me, the contract options were not the same. Once again, I contacted the corporate office to allow them the opportunity to make up for what I perceived to be a lack of concern. Well guess what, as professional and courteous as the various representatives could be; respectfully declined to reopen, open or create a new account with the same stipulations. Was I asking a lot? Absolutely not. But when you are a number to a company and not a customer, client and really a partner to the companies success; they do not feel as though they need to do anything outside of the current promotional sales pitch.I am truly eager to support companies who not only do right by their investors or themselves, but also the many individuals who make them who they are. Shame on you LA Fitness for not stepping up to the plate and welcoming me back!"

She has HER training routine that we do with her. She is a stay home mom with 3 kids - 2 have special needs so she does not personal train anyone since she has no time to. Her husband just recently joined the gym to work out with us - while working out last Thurs night we were approached by the head personal training MGR who without introducing himself started accusing my friend of personal training myself and her husband. Now there were 3 men working out right next to us doing the same thing, but he did not say anything to them and lots of people that work out & help each other with spotting, coaching and making sure form is right - but nothing said to them. I have never had anyone from that gym offer to help me or introduce their self to us - they sit in a office laughing and talking the whole time and act like they OWN the gym. I asked for a apology and he said our contract said NO COACHING - so if you are looking for BAD PERSONAL TRAINING studio - this would be the place for you, but if you are looking for a gym to workout in peace and have FUN - BEWARE.

I suffered a slip & fall in the women's locker room/shower area because the facility did not use skid mats on the floor. The water soaked mats on the floor skidded right out from under me and I suffered a concussion, contusions, and other muscular injuries... court ruled that the EXCULPATORY CLAUSE was enforceable! That's right I got nothing for my pain & suffering, loss wages, and medical. BE AWARE!!!"
956,757265,2014-02-13,2,"I joined LA Fitness over one year ago. At the time I joined I was encouraged to pay the member's fee for myself and my husband, who was uncertain as to whether he would actually participate. I was told they would grant him membership whether he attended or not. The fee was pretty steep: $365, which seemed a lot to me but I was assured it was not much considering the fact that I would be charged $29 a month from then on and that my husband would pay $39 a month. My husband only agreed to join if the pool was open. The delay in opening the pool was a point in contention for both of us. The gym didn't open the pool for 6 months. I finally cancelled my husband's membership after they kept on saying it would open in 2 weeks but it never did open. They didn't reimburse us for all of the months we continued being charged for being members without a pool. I also signed up for a personal trainer. I was treated to a series of delays with respect to a person being assigned to me. But, I was assured I would eventually have someone who was competent. I am 66 years old. Eventually I was assigned to John, who was 22 years old and very flip about making appointments. He didn't show up a number of times, didn't call and let me know even though the appointments were for 8 AM and I showed up each time. Finally, John decided to move on. I was assigned to Devine. A very nice man who showed up once and then decided to leave the organization. I'm not sure why. I went to the administrator and told them I didn't want to be part of their physical trainer program anymore. I felt like I was being shifted from person to person and bounced around to people who weren't very responsible. They told me I was obligated to be part of the program and would be charged regardless. I had a lawyer look at the contract and it did seem like I would continue to be charged so I decided it was too much money to just pour down the drain. The person in charge was a 22 year old kid who seemed embarrassed by all the stuff going on and didn't really know how to deal with it. He agreed that I was being given a raw deal and had met all of my commitments. I was then told I was to be assigned to Gene. He was reliable and I was glad to work with him. He decided to leave after about 6 months because he felt the organization wasn't being honest with its clients. He confided that to me. I was told I was about to be charged more money for my appointments with Gene because he was a ""master"" trainer. This was news to me and to Gene. After all it was late in the game to decide he was a master trainer (he is only 24) as well and though a good, reliable person, it didn't seem fair to up his fee in the middle of a contract. I had decided to just go with an ordinary trainer, but Gene decided to quit LA Fitness because he felt uncomfortable with all the shenanigans. He had to explain to all of his clients how his fee was suddenly going up despite the fact that he had a relationship with them. I spoke with a few other clients who I had seen working with Gene. They were all sad to see him go but pissed off about the fees going up in the middle of a contract. I was then assigned to Jesse, who is 22 years old and very nice. He seems to be fairly reliable, though today I got an e-mail from LA Fitness telling me I have an appointment for Friday, though I cancelled it with Jesse early on this week because I have the flu. When I went into the computer to try to cancel it they told me it was too late? How could that be when I cancelled it a few days ago???LA Fitness has nice equipment, though the weights are often scattered all over the place, and you could trip if you don't keep your eyes on the ground. They don't employ staff to keep the weights in their proper places, which would be helpful to clients. They also don't fix things that are broken in a timely way. I have had to report several machines that weren't working by taking photos of the numbers on the machine and bringing it to the attention of the main desk. I find the machines still broken days later. This is a new facility, only open for a year and a few months. It is not managed well. I have complained about the machines not being operational (specifically the rowing machine, and others). As I said, they were not fixed in a timely way. I gave up trying to use them rather than feel upset.The classes are often cancelled. No notice is given ahead of time. Teachers seem to come and go. The classes never seem to cater to older people. They are all at the highest fast level. Even the yoga class only suits people who are in perfect condition, young and fit. I am fairly fit and have taken yoga in a variety of places. Usually, teachers try to meet the needs of everyone in the class and make suggestions of how to vary postures, etc. This is not true of the L.A. Fitness classes. I think that's because there is no supervision of the teachers. Everyone just does their own thing, whatever that means.If I was going to start all over I would not use this gym and certainly would not recommend it to other people. Unfortunately, I feel like I've invested a lot of money in the place and would like to be able to use it. As an older adult, I feel like I'm not taken seriously even though I am dedicated to remaining fit and see the gym as a place where I can maintain my health by being active."
957,757018,2014-02-13,1,"I signed up for a regular gym membership during a 3 month business visit to another state. After signing up, LA Fitness will make a hard push to sell you a personal trainer membership. After being reassured by their salesperson that it would be easy to get out of the contract after I moved back to my home state (where LA Fitness is not available), I signed the contract. At the end of my visit, I went to the gym to cancel my memberships. Having paid for 3 months and only used 2 1/2, I thought that would be the end of it, but LA Fitness kept billing me $262 each month although I live hundreds of miles from their closest gym. In total, they charged me ~$1,400 before I finally got American Express to block them from making further charges. I am now going through the second round of disputing the charges through AmEx and will go through the Better Business Bureau after that. The money is the least of it: the process has cost me a lot of time, frustrations, and loss of trust in companies that come across as reputable at first glance. One other note is that LA Fitness seems remarkably adept at getting complaints about them deleted from consumer websites."
958,755784,2014-02-10,1,"The representatives here are the worst . A basic sales representative from a grocery store is far better compared to these people. I strongly feel this corporate does not even know what is meant by service. All they talk about when they call is money money money like a blood sucking leech. I don't have any issue paying the money but, I was asking them to schedule an appointment with a representative and they simply we call from corporate place and we ask you about money. The most annoying part they call about 10-15 times in a day and just ask money. All I want to say is LEARN SOME MANNERS AND EDUCATE YOUR REPS ABOUT DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS AND TRY TO LISTEN WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS ASKING FOR. And the worst part is the representative over the center wants to meet his target and he manipulates the contract for his greediness. The WORST WORST WORST corporate center which I have never seen."
959,753506,2014-02-03,1,"I began a gym membership with LA Fitness in Glendale on Jan 2nd '14. The basic membership for myself and my girlfriend was $130 ($65 each - my girlfriend paid her own half of $65 for the first month). Once we had signed up for our basic gym membership I was talked and ""sold"" into accepting a fitness instructor for one hour of each week of the month. The fitness instructor then tried to get me to commit to more hours per week with him but I finally agreed only to just one hour for each week. This put a much heavier cost on the membership of which I accepted; however I was not totally aware of the ruthless small print of the fitness instructor contract, should I be forced for any unforeseeable reason to cancel the contract with the fitness instructor program. Two separate charges for basic gym membership were debited from my bank account on Feb 2nd for $34.99 and for $29.99 respectively (for myself and my girlfriend respectively). The cost of a fitness instructor came with a one time insurance fee - the total of which came to $140, which was debited from my account on Feb 3rd '14, which is today (Monday).This may all seem fairly normal so far. However, around the 10th of Jan., my father was admitted into St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica for a life threatening health issue that could have killed him without treatment. The month of January ended up being consumed with hospital visits and then once my father was discharged from the hospital I had to stay with him in West Hollywood for much of the rest of January, making a lot of journeys to and from Glendale to his home in West Hollywood. Right before my father went into the hospital, I made just one visit to LA Fitness and spent just one hour with the fitness instructor. The remaining 1 hour per week of fitness instructor visits for the rest of January (after my first and only visit to LA Fitness after joining and signing) I was forced to postpone because I suddenly found myself with no time to attend LA Fitness due to the dramatic turn of events regarding my father's health.But the real big issue that had now surfaced - was that as my father was now suddenly unable to travel overseas to make some necessary money for himself and his family - some of which supplements my income, I suddenly found myself struggling toward the end of January financially - a position that caught me off guard - and so on Saturday, 1st Feb, I called LA Fitness and requested that due to these new mitigating financial circumstances - could they please cancel my membership to their gym in full, as my bank account had dropped dangerously low to $294.98 and the money that I was expecting to arrive was no longer coming.I was told to visit my branch of LA Fitness on Monday (today). I was praying that they didn't take any of what was left in my account before I got the chance to cancel my membership today by paying the gym a visit. When I looked at my bank account today, I discovered to my horror that there was only $90.02 left in there. LA Fitness had debited my account before I had a chance to stop it or cancel. Once I got to LA Fitness (around 9am) I implored them to please refund the $204.98 that they had just taken from my account as I now had no immediate income. I was forced to disclose to 3 separate LA Fitness employees the very private nature of my current financial position, that my father was in hospital, etc. - and that I now needed that money for basic living expenses such as food and gas.They told me point blank that I signed a 1-year CONTRACT, and that it was impossible to cancel it unless I paid a cancellation fee of over $700 (somewhere in the region of $750). I told them that was absolutely absurd considering my sudden downturn fiscally, that I now had only $90.02 in my account and could they please at least take into account my new circumstances and promptly cancel my entire membership without a cancellation fee, because I cannot afford to cancel with only $90.02 in my bank account.I was given a number to call to discuss my issue with an LA Fitness manager. I was told on the phone the same thing - that I was bound to the contract and that under California State Law, I was unable to cancel my membership without being subject to an inordinate and highly excessive fee which I couldn't even cover one seventh of with my current bank balance. This has led me to the position of being forced to go into my bank tomorrow and disputing the LA Fitness debit transactions. My chances of winning a case against the LA Fitness corporation seem quite slim, though I am hoping that I will be temporarily credited by my bank the amount that they debited while the dispute is in process, thus giving me the chance to get my bank balance back up to almost $300. The only other step it seems that I can take at this point is to cancel my debit card and get a new one so LA Fitness cannot continue to debit money from my bank account next month and so forth on my existing debit card.I feel that LA Fitness have painted me into a corner and that there must be some way for an individual to defend themselves against such a predatory business model against a single individual who suddenly finds themselves in an unexpected situation financially, with no apparent remorse nor rational person to discuss terminating a membership in a civilized and humane manner that guarantees the safety and the basic respect of the individual in question."
960,752854,2014-02-01,1,"I just joined LA Fitness two weeks ago and I am absolutely shocked at how unprofessional your instructors are. I attended a 7:00 pm Zumba class with an instructor named Annette on 1/23/2014. It was her birthday and there was cake and balloons and she took pictures with some of the students for about 10 minutes. Class started 10 minutes late. Annette then asked if anyone minded if she recorded us for a video. When a student said she did mind, Annette told her to get out. She then mocked her by saying in a baby voice, ""Oh, I don't want to be in your Zumba video,"" and then said, ""I don't need this **. If you don't want to be in my video then GET OUT."" The girl put a hooded sweatshirt over her head so she would not be in the video since Annette already had another student recording on her iPad. At the end of the class she offered Zumba classes in her home for an additional fee. Why would you have an instructor that mimics and mocks her students? Why would you allow an instructor to record on your premises? Why is she allowed to solicit students to her home for an extra fee? Is LA Fitness covering her insurance liability should something happen to a student on her property?"

962,751475,2014-01-28,1,Went to the website 2 weeks ago to cancel my membership. This was not an option online. I had to print and mail in a cancellation form for my and my daughter’s membership. This was mailed out approx. 10 days ago. I am still being charged and according to them they have received no cancellation. I've talked to someone at the local gym and someone in a California location. They have told me 2 different things. One said since a cancellation was sent in I “probably” don’t owe anything. The second told me to “just go ahead and pay the balance”. So I called my club again and the person agreed to cancel my membership over the phone right now which I thought was a good thing except I got the cancellation email and they want me to pay $29.99 for each of my and my daughter’s cancelled membership. I also mentioned that I thought when you signed up you paid 1st and last month’s fees so this would not be an issue? They said that the last month would actually be next month and it would be “free”. Needless to say I am very angry and guess I will have to pay the balance they say I owe to keep it from going to a collection agency and hurting my credit.

I don't even remember ever using the facilities. They automatically assumed to freeze, but not to cancel since I never used the facilities. I have had financial hardship due to illness over the years due to medical disabilities to find out that this multi-million dollar company has been withdrawing monies from my account even when I no longer live in the same state. They have taken approximately $840.00 dollars from my account. I believe it is extremely unreasonable for them to believe that they can continue to take monies from me without any limitations.

I also paid $15.00 for a one day pass. No one bothered to show me around. My friend gave me a tour of the facility. The weekend Manager at a Riverside doesn't belong at LA Fitness. He was rude and unprofessional. I don't recommend LA Fitness!!! If you want to be treated with RESPECT, don't go to LA Fitness please!!!"

At first, in May, when we signed up, the chair lift to the pool was functional and with exception of when the trainer was ill and was away on vacation, we were able to get her in the pool. The chair lift became nonfunctional in July; therefore, she was unable to get in the pool safely and training was cancelled BUT..... I was still being billed for the training that never happened. They will not reimburse me because as far as ""corporate"" was concerned, she was receiving the training. The specific club in Kirkland, WA never told them of the non-functioning chair lift. I am still fighting with them with American Express who has investigated them. They do not have specifics to back their claim."

I've called and complained about this matter and requested to have my funds returned to the account. 1 Month later, still no refund and another charge!

I have called numerous times and complained to the manager - and it gets better for a few weeks - and then it seems like nobody cares! I can't understand why there is only 1 soap dispenser in the Women's locker room (on the wall) and all of the dispensers near each of the six (6) sinks is broken or empty. Machines are filthy (Elliptical, treadmills) - not sure why since I work out each morning when the club opens at 5:00 AM. Does this mean the cleaning crew sleeps all night? There is no reason why we should see sweat & water residue on the machine and in the cup dispensers when the club 1st opens - leads me to believe the machines are not cleaned nightly. The benches in the Women's locker room have a greasy film on them - are they not wiping these down each night? Half of the bikes in the cycle room are broken - the odometers simply do not work! Ugh!"
972,730960,2013-11-12,1,"I signed up for an LA Fitness account at the Waukegan, IL location back in October 2011. I worked out 3 times a week for 2 months, with a trainer, who specified a plan towards my disabilities, at least I thought so at the time. I had an ok from my doctor to do a light workout routine. So I gave it a go. I had done too much and ended up hurting myself while working out and caused a flare up with recurring back injury. After seeing my doctor, he had told me that I would not be able to do these workouts able due to the stress on my body. He then wrote me a medical waiver to give to the gym, so that they would cancel out my membership without further charges. I spoke with Kristen, gm of location, gave her the documents and she expressed concern but told me she would cancel out membership and that I wouldn't have to worry about anything else. I didn't receive anything in the mail further regarding this membership, so I thought I was ok. Well, apparently that was not the case. Out of the blue I get an email saying unable to pay dues. Please contact your local gym for details. To my surprise after calling my local gym, I find out they have been charging my account $10 a month for the last 18 months. Wow! Then they tell me there's no records Kristen ever filed my paperwork, when I walked them into her specifically. Then they tell me they emailed me receipts, when I explained I no longer use that email and haven't for years, they said that wasn't their problem. So, here I am getting talked to like a little girl by their ""upper management"" who care to not take any of the responsibility. They tell me my account was frozen and because it was frozen I had to pay for it. I explained why would it be frozen when it was supposed to be canceled?! How can they choose to freeze my account, and charge me without my permission? Something really shady! Thieves! They tell me I had to have requested it, ummmm no! I requested it be canceled, my doctor did to be exact! But Nope, still out $200! Needless to say, I will never go back and ask of the business that I sent them will be canceling as well, so in the long run, they will be the losers, all because they wanted to steal someone's money. I don't do business with crooks! Don't go to LA Fitness, try Snap Fitness, Fitness 24, or any other gym facility. Do not give them your hard earned money. They don't deserve it!"

I can do nothing today since the GM and customer service do not work on the weekend. After reading here, I may well have to go to the BBB, and place a complaint. I will decide after I call them on Monday, but they should not legally be able to hit your bank account unless you have agreed. I can't believe this is legal."

Only 2 urinals and 2 stalls for a place that large. Joining for a membership not done legally, had a charge on my credit card that the person in charge at LA Fitness said was in my contract, which I did not and would not have signed.

Spoke with the manager and was told they did not have a policy that prevented jewelry from being worn in the kids' room. Worse yet, another mother overheard my question to the manager and began to get in my face and argue about whether kids should wear jewelry in kids' room. None of the LA Fitness staff intervened or asked the mother to back off. The corporate office did nothing as well.

Five months, and five hundred dollar later, I am disputing the charges with my credit card company. LA Fitness is STILL finding a way to charge my account!!! I am beyond furious. Capital One says some companies just push and re-charge and get through. LA is one of those companies. Cap One will have to re-dispute until LA Fitness lays off. I have filed a dispute with the BBB. Their business practices are totally unfair. They mislead people and take their money w/o giving them any product.

They called me from 5 different numbers (all leaving a voice mail since I didn't recognize the numbers) from various area codes. And those 5 calls have been coming in EVERY DAY, even AFTER I talked to my local LA Fitness and told them that I cancelled the membership. Only then was I told about the special form, but they told me to come in to the club. After finding out (by researching) that it has to be mailed to corporate, I went to the website and found that you have to have a member account (I didn't have one) to gain access to the form. I was going to make an online account until it asked for billing account information. I did a Google search and found the form. I am mailing in tomorrow along with a note about not knowing in the first place that I needed a special form. All I was told was ""Inform us in writing 30 days in advance."" I am NEVER going back to LA Fitness!!"
980,723845,2013-10-14,1,"I signed up at LA Fitness and for a year of personal trainer. I asked the guy repeatedly if any of the trainers were degreed in sports medicine as I have severe arthritis and he assured me they were, repeatedly. This was a lie. I started with a trainer, I knew her personally and knew she did not have a college degree as she had been working as a secretary a few years prior, but I thought, ""Oh well, I will give this a go."" Apparently, they have a standard workout they use for almost everyone. I told the trainer I had arthritis, had been very inactive, and was also overweight. The workouts she put me through were so intense, I became inflamed all over my body, injured my heel and tendon. I also would get a migraine right after the workout. So, I got a new trainer, who advised me to try and get out of the contract and just do water activities. Both of these had quit 6 months later. At present, this new facility only has 3 trainers and the hours they are available is mostly in the daytime when working people can not come. This was the worst I have ever been scammed in my life! I like the facility itself, but the personal training is like your worst experience with ""used car sales."" I have lost all respect for this company and their unethical practices."
981,723830,2013-10-14,1,"In February of this year, 2013, I joined LA Fitness in College Park Georgia. Several days later, I inquired about their personal training program and was told I could choose my payment date. A few months later, I discovered they had debited my account several days before the agreed upon date which created an overdraft. After my failed attempts to handle this with the local manager, I contacted the Better Business Bureau. Several days later, I was contacted by the local VP and was reimbursed the $35.00. A month later, it happened again and I contacted the corporate office to understand why this was happening. At that time, I was told they no longer go by the date designated by the consumer (member) and all accounts are billed every 28 days. I did not argue this, even though there were no prior notification there would be a change in their billing policy. For the month of September, my checking account was debited on the 9th and for the month of October it was billed on the 7th. This did not correspond with the 28-day billing cycle, I was told, so I contacted the corporate office again. This time, I was told accounts are billed the 4th Friday of every month??? This is when I knew I needed to ask for assistance from BBB and Consumer Affairs. How can a corporation of this magnitude arbitrarily debit an account at any time they chose to change a policy? How am I to manage my finances when this occurs? Is this legal and is there any recourse I can take to stop this? I was told I could cancel my training but will have to pay 50% of what is remaining on the contract. How do they get away with this unethical practice????"
982,723529,2013-10-12,2,"LA Fitness in Wellington, FL has very obvious health and safety violations including but not limited to broken equipment, unsanitary restrooms and locker rooms, and the pool has slime build up, and unfinished ceiling, dirt and other sediment at the bottom, and the deck is also very dirty. I have spoken to the management and even corporate offices to no avail. They recently had to take down one of the murals in the pool area because they placed it over wall paper which created mold! The instructors are AMAZING. You will definitely get a good workout. I recommend the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday aquafit classes (am or pm). The cycling class is a real butt kicker as well, they get full fast so be sure to check in at least 30 min. beforehand. The staff/management on the other hand are OUTRAGEOUSLY RUDE! They treat you as if you are creating a problem for them when you enter the building. The kids' club is a joke! They don't change diapers or feed the kids. So if you're a mom trying to get back into shape, they will come get you in the middle of a workout to come and change, feed, or calm your baby down from crying too much. So that extra $10 a month for kids' club is to have a chaperon in the room while the kids run wild.The juice bar is good, depending on who is working that day. The equipment is cramped together but they do offer a wide variety for every body part which is awesome. Wish that they had sanitary wipes to wipe down the machines before and after use; but I guess for that location, that is way too much to ask. The other locations in West Palm and North Lake aren't nearly as horrid as this one. The Wellington location is a result of piss poor management."
983,722752,2013-10-10,1,"I have had 2 horrible experiences with LA Fitness. They purchased my gym and my membership was transferred over to LA Fitness at the same rate as my previous gym, 'for a period of time'. The rates eventually went up when my contract expired. I tried to cancel after realizing it was too much to pay for a luxury item. It took approx. 6 months to cancel my membership. All the while, they kept taking money out of my bank account. I was never reimbursed for any of the charges. I swore I would not use them again. They were sued as part of a class action lawsuit and I was given the opportunity to try the gym again for 3 months. After attending, I was approached by a salesman who tried to sell me services. I ultimately decided to get a personal trainer under a 1-year contract. I specifically told the salesperson, I have a budget that I must stick to. Once I signed up for the service, I used 3 of my sessions before I was approached by the same man after walking in the door. He said, ""You don't have a membership here."" I thought he was cuckoo - didn't he remember signing me up? As it turns out, even though I was paying $140 a month for a personal trainer, I was not allowed to enter the gym and use the facilities without an additional membership fee which has a broad range of prices. At the time I signed up, I was not informed there would be additional charges for use of the gym. In addition, the salesman told me that I can't expect too much as far as results go, because I am 'getting older' - 40. He also hassled me about drinking vitamin water and that my office job wasn't doing me any favors. I am 5'8 and I weigh 140. What's more, is that the personal trainer never took my body measurements, BMI or discussed any physical limitations with me. I tried to speak with the Corporate office who told me to speak to the local branch manager. I spoke with the local manager who was extremely rude and condescending. In short, she told me that I am liable for the $140 12-mo. contract but I cannot use the gym unless I give them more of my hard-earned money. What ever happened to customer service and fairness!! LA Fitness is stealing from people and in this economy, a gym membership is a luxury that few can afford. They have overdrawn my account and charged me miscellaneous charges for which I have gotten no explanation, and have left me with no money in my account and overdraft charges when I should be buying groceries and gas!!! I am now going to Gold's Gym which is $15.95/mo. with an annual fee of $39."

The most ironic part is it was the same people at the front desk and the same GM. How does a gym like this have such unprofessional staff? They couldn't find the pass, they didn't know about the 2 weeks free trial and finally they let me wait for the longest time - just because they were chatting among each other. The incident was so bad that the member who invited me decided to cancel his membership. This is at their Haskell location in Dallas TX. Please avoid a bad experience and don't go there."

When I asked why I was signing a contract, he lied again and said it was for waiving rights to a lawsuit. I swore I read that thing page to page and I thought it said ""month to month"". I did the training for 6 months, then was laid off. The training was for $400/mo. and I couldn't afford it. I tried cancelling but they said, ""Sorry, it's a year contract."" I suspended it for 3 months. Then I tried suspending it another 3 months and they said, ""Sorry, no back to back suspensions."" So I spent $400 for in November that I didn't even use. Then I tried to suspend it for another 3 months and they were like, ""Sorry, no more suspensions are allowed on your account.""The manager was smirking at me and saying that of course I could buy out my contract at any time. It would just cost $2,000. I said, ""I don't have $2,000,"" and he said, ""Sure you do!"" while smirking at me. It was infuriating! I attempted to negotiate a payment plan with the gym. They said speak to corporate. I spoke with corporate over 10 hours trying to get a payment plan so as not to destroy my credit, but they were like, ""You can choose to pay the $2,000 up front now, or you're going to collections."" SO now, a year later, it has gone to collections and it ruined my credit. I felt horribly misguided and lied to, and they wouldn't do ANYTHING to help me rectify this situation, not even a payment plan on the full amount they claimed I owed. Ridiculous."

They lie to you to get you into a contract saying that it could be cancelled any month only to find out that there are no such MONTHLY contracts! Then your stuck with a year spending hundreds of dollars!!!!!! I signed up with this gym in June and they suckered me into a ""FREE"" training session. I went to see what it was about and after doing a quick 25 minute session I was asked to sign up for a trial. It was explained to me that I could do three times a week at a low fee and try it out month to month. I signed up like a (insert profanity here). I went to my first training session only to find out that the person who signed me up didn't do training and was actually booked with a young guy who had NO interest in actually training me. The entire time he stared off into space or looking at everyone else not giving any direction to me the paying customer!! When I went again I received the same results.

Yes I initialed on a small little ELECTRONIC signature pad by their desk. How do I know that my initials were not ""copied"" to those sections? When I let him know he told me it was a monthly deal he of course denied it. Called their supposed ""corporate"" office and got the same stupid response!! The only way they would make it better for me is to set me up with another trainer. Feeling defeated, I went to the other trainer and got the same result as the first one!!!!!!!!!!!I then had to go to another gym and try out their trainers. When I finally found someone who actually cares and pushed me I was then informed that I would need to PAY MORE BECAUSE MY TRAINER NEEDED A RAISE!!!!!! Never was I informed that I would be penalized when the gym decides to implement a ""MASTERS"" trainer program. Then two weeks ago my mother decides to sign up for the gym and was offered the same free training session. When she spoke with the training sales director, this lady told my mother that she could try the program for THIRTY DAYS!!!!! And if she likes it she could go month to month. When she informed me of this I immediately asked her to give me her contract to read because my understanding there wasn't a ""MONTHLY"" program. My mother then informs me that they never gave her a copy!!!!!! I let her know she needed to get it from ASAP as it is the GYM'S responsibility to give her a contract. When she went to the gym and asked for a copy of the contract she was informed that they emailed those documents over to her. My mother does not have an email account!!! They gave her the runaround until the grace period of canceling the contract was over.... HOW CONVENIENT!! Now my mother is stuck with a year contract as well.When I contacted the sales director she informed me that they ""stopped"" the practice of lying to customers when she started in April.... She then informed me that the person who signed me up was known for doing this as well.

I am unable to work and I am on medical disability until the birth of my child. I explained all of this information in detail to the representative at LA fitness over the phone. He explained in order to cancel my membership I would have to physically walk into the fitness center when a manager was present and there was no other alternative despite my medical situation. Due to my inability to work my income and has since changed and it was my intention to not incur any unnecessary expenses. So due to these reasons I physically walked into the clinic in order to avoid any further charge from LA fitness. I'm surprised that they do not have a policy in place or make exceptions when a member has a medical reason for being unable to physically go to the fitness center.

Little did she know that she was signing up for a year's worth of training not just short term training over the summer as she had hoped. We discovered the $240 charge on the credit card bill for September training.

I was told at the time by the sales associate that the last month's payment was for the last month you cancel. I moved and called LA Fitness to inform them I wanted to cancel my membership. First off, when I went to cancel they told me that I had to write in a letter to corporate cancelling my membership. I ended up writing a letter and had NO response. I called and they said they never got it. I sent another one in. During this time I had my credit card stolen, so 3 weeks later LA Fitness tried to bill me (a month after I cancelled) and wasn't able to so they called and called and called. I finally said to them I had cancelled a month ago and that they had a last month's payment anyway. I hadn't been in the gym for 2 months. The lady on the phone was extremely rude. She sound exactly like a bank. I was told that because they hadn't received my letter, after I sent it twice, I still owe another month plus the last month's payment. So essentially she was saying I had to pay for an extra 3 months of dues after I cancelled. The person on the phone obviously wasn't educated, because I kept telling her things. All she would respond with sounded like a bank. ""It was in the fine print. The associate explained it to you"". I denied it and said that was what was never said to me, but she always went back to the 'fine print'.In the end I paid them the extra $30 because all she did was threaten my credit. For $30 it wasn't worth it. I want people to know how horrible a business this place runs. In all honestly I've been a member at numerous gyms, and LA Fitness is EXTREMELY FILTHY!!! The associates DO NOT clean anything, it's almost disgusting. I go to other gyms and a couple times a day you see trainers and other associates at least cleaning the equipment real quick. It's not fun getting on an elliptical machine that has dirt EVERYWHERE, looking like it hasn't been wiped down in weeks.

Next supervisor same response and insults and calling me a liar, then refusing to let me speak to anyone above him and laughing at me when I asked for his name so I could go above him. This company has given me the WORST customer service I have ever experienced while taking advantage of people and condoning their employees lying to customers."
995,706360,2013-08-07,1,"I was a long customer with Bally's, since 1994, and I recently (2012) had to renew the membership that LA FITNESS now owned but I was told that I had to pay for two years. Apparently, when I paid for two years of membership service with Bally's in 2010 that meant I had to pay for two years from now on. So LA FITNESS informed me that I had to pay for two years of service or get switched over to a new account. I had requested paying month-to-month because I was unemployed at the time and I was in the process of losing my home to foreclosure. I thought it would be best to keep the membership but try to cut some monthly cost where I could. I thought this was a no brainer to pay month to month and they would just update the account payment status. The LA FITNESS manager in Broadview, IL said that if I wanted to pay month to month that I would be considered a NEW member and this meant paying a new contract and starting all over. This meant paying the dues, increased monthly bills for service that I have had since 1994. I paid my dues with Bally's and have been a long customer without any issues and now they refused to modify my membership payment status ""by default"" and requested that I start a new membership. There was no way considering my situation that I would even start a new membership. Just heartless, pathetic customer service folks at LA FITNESS.Bally Fitness did EVERYTHING to work with YOU to make sure you stayed with them, and they did what it took customer service wise to keep you as a member. LA FITNESS is ONLY concerned with the bottom line and trying to switch the Bally people to start a new membership so they can suck money out of our pockets. LA FITNESS lacks the customer base to understand what the customer needs and how to address our concerns. I was in a financial economic hardship when I needed to renew and they just turned their pathetic heads and demanded I pay up or start a new account.I hope and pray that LA FITNESS understands what they are doing and change this service because they are losing all of the committed members who were lifers... Bally Fitness was head and shoulders a much better, more committed company than LA FITNESS and it's sad to know that after all these years, I have to start anew with some other fitness center.LA FITNESS...BALLY'S had you BEAT WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT WAY!!"
996,704711,2013-07-30,1,"I signed up for a year training contract which is additional to the monthly charge. I had been using the services for almost half of the contract and I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that caused a drastic change in my life. This resulted in having to cancel the membership along with the personal training. I am a 20-year-old college student so the additional cost of medical expenses and having to resign from work making it additionally impossible to do the training. I gave a medical note from my doctor and had to have it sent to corporate by mail. I was initially told by several employees including a corporate representative that due to the automatic billing of my account I would be refunded the month in which was intended to not use. And so I find out that the doctor notice I sent was not sufficient for them to cancel my contract and resulted in a second month of me being billed amounting now to: $520.00. I called again corporate and in contrary to what was told to me multiple times, I would not receive a refund of any month. A second note directly from my hospital has been sent and due to the inconsistency of this company I was not made aware what the physician had to disclose in the letter claiming to cancel the gym services. I am infuriated because this isn't the first time I hear of this incompetent company doing this. It clearly represents the corporate culture within the organization and this cannot go unnoticed by the public. The treatment I most recently have been receiving is one of an apathetic bureaucracy rather than a customer driven business. The behavior and practices of LA Fitness within its corporate structure and management is adamantly unacceptable and despicable."
997,703149,2013-07-23,1,"It's unfortunate that it took a naked jaunt down Hollywood Blvd for me to finally send you belated congratulations on the successful acquisition of the Bally Fitness clubs here in the Los Angeles area. As a 21-year member of Bally, now LA Fitness, I just wanted to commend you on mastering the inorganic business model so popular today. Indeed, the old organic model of growing a business through good products and quality services is simply too slow. By downgrading to cheap products and abysmal services - one can rapidly harvest cash for merger and acquisition targets a more efficient growth model for sure, and by all measures, you are a master at this! So I am writing to share my excellent customer service experience with you personally. After showering at your club at 1628 N. El Centro on July 8th, I was surprised to find my locker burgled and all of my possessions gone - car keys, bag, lock, phone, wallet, even my dirty gym clothes - the works! I was informed by your staff that there is no liability for the actual theft (which I assumed) but here's the best part; your staff was impeccably trained on the inorganic business principle of ""abysmal services"" and no matter what I asked, or how I pleaded for mercy, they successfully avoided any liability, responsibility or even a modicum of human kindness. The manager, **, answered all my questions. For example; Q: I need to speak with securityA: We have no security. Q: Can you find something from lost and found for me to wear?A: We have no lost and found. Q: Can you alert the parking attendant not to let my car out?A: No.It became pretty clear that any additional attempts at garnering support, information, comfort, or any basic human kindness was a useless exercise. In fact, upon each answer, she attempted to turn away and avoid continued discussion leaving me half naked in the public lobby, clutching a dripping towel to my privates for the 45 minutes I was begging for mercy. So all options gone, out the front door I went, half naked, my pride swinging in the breeze (and I didn't even get arrested for indecency!). No money, no phone, no idea how I would race the burglars back to my house, or if my car was being burgled or stolen from your parking lot. An utter lack of security personnel or cameras, no company policy for such events, no training, or consideration of public accommodation, just good old fashion negligence - you've built a lean and mean (and I do mean mean) organization that is destined to take its place next to the likes of Ameriquest, Charter Communications, and other roll-up companies in America.How many times have you been forced out the front door of a business naked? I guess I'm just out of touch with my inner-exhibitionist not to have found my forced nudity, public humiliation, fear and emotional distress exciting. At least I got a whistle from a passing Corolla, so I guess my 21 years at your gym was worth it after all!P.S. Cancel my membership and send me a 21-year refund."
998,701834,2013-07-17,1,"On Monday July 15th I walked into LA Fitness located on 13350 Northwest Freeway, Houston, TX 77040 to shop for a membership for my wife and I, alright so ended up talking/buying from the General manager whose name Is **, LA Fitness employee number **. OK, so basically I agreed to buy two memberships at the price of $78.00 x 2 (first and last month) +1_$49.00 (initiation fee) + tax for both memberships, for a single club use, with no hour restrictions. One of the memberships includes kids club use for 2 kids (my wife's). He never handed me a hard copy of the agreements/contracts; instead he e-mailed them to me, showing a completely different (RECURRING) billing charge to what we had agreed to, which has nothing to do with tax or any other thing I was informed about. I understand they have to charge for taxes, so that's OK. So any away the contracts show an increase of $12.00 a month plus 8.25% ($1)tax = $13.00 extra above the price we agreed. Interestingly enough the first charge is almost accurate - its $1.00 above the actual charges - but on the (RECURRING) monthly dues when we combine the charges it adds up to $89 + TAX."
999,701647,2013-07-16,1,"I joined through my large corporation to get the discount from LA Fitness. Was talked into a 1 year personal training agreement, swore I could quit anytime, was totally and unadulteratedly lied to, and am now stuck unless I pay them $1500 to get out of my contract! The trainers are terrible (mine has a foul body odor problem and doesn't know it?), the woman that sold me down the river acts like nothing happened, and suckers still others into training contracts (the heartless soulless **), and like everyone else states. LA Fitness is like a meat market. I'm guessing I'm going to have to go to my company and register a complaint to get them taken off as preferred discount status so my coworkers don't suffer the same fate as me. Hell is going to be full of LA Fitness salespeople and management."
1000,700028,2013-07-09,1,"They insist you must go to a location manager to cancel. I changed my debit card number so now the automatic payment will not go through. I have received 8 calls in 3 days, all saying they will make my file, but I get another call. Their accounting says you have to do it in writing. I say, ""You are sending me an email that the payment didn't go through, and I responded to that same email and you will not cancel."" I refuse to go to a gym to cancel and hear some high pressure sales job. I told the lady this time, continue to call then. I am not playing your game. I WILL NOT mail you a cancellation because you sent me an EMAIL wanting the payment fixed. I am retired, I will outlast them. And I am telling ALL my friends not to go to this gym. It's a meat market. They are always trying to get you to sign up for private sessions... I go to a small gym now and enjoy it much more."
1001,699845,2013-07-08,1,"Paid for 2 months for my daughter, who is in vet school, and she was denied after the first month. LA Fitness wanted more money. Contacted the branch I paid at and home office and they said that more money was owed. All they want is to get you into a long contract."
1002,699467,2013-07-07,1,"This review is not regarding the facilities or services of the LA Fitness in La Verne. It's about nobody else but one sales guy. I'll call him ""B"" in here. So it was in April when he came up to me at Claremont Colleges. He offered me a free trial at their gym. When I went in there for the trial, I was stupid enough to let him talk me into a ""student special."" Honestly, I'm not interested in the membership at all because there is a gym in my community, which costs nothing. I thought I'd give it a try because B said to me, ""Today is the last day for the student special with a monthly fee of $30 something (can't recall the exact amount). As part of the special, you pay for two months and can quit the membership and get the full refund ($60 something) back any time during the two months.""I believed that it seemed not making sense to anyone, so I asked him that what if I quit right before the end of the second month. He assured me that the full amount would be reimbursed to me. After confirming that for a couple of times, I joined the membership which was the start of the disappointing experience. My mistake was my negligence to look at the contract (they didn't show me the contract upfront anyways, but emailed me) and that I didn't ask for a written proof of the ""full refund anytime during the two months"" from B so that I have no way to prove now.Well after 3 weeks or so, I decided to quit and get my refund back. Apparently, the front desk didn't have any idea of what I was talking about (at that time I already felt that the whole refund anytime thing might be totally made up by B). However, B told me that the front desk couldn't do this and that he could do it by asking the corporate office to send me a check (why corporate office?). Not out of expectation, the check was never in my mailbox. I met with B for three times about the mythical check. He let me wait and wait, and in the end he said that he would personally reimburse me (I doubt if he asked the corporate office at the very beginning).Here comes the most disappointing part. We decided to meet at 7PM on June 25 (because he said he got his paycheck that day). I was there at 6:55. He texted saying he's almost there. After a while, he still didn't show up so I asked if he was far away. He said no, he just got busy and he's leaving now. I called but he didn't pick up. At 7:30 I told him if he didn't show up in 3 minutes, I would just go home and file a complaint. Waited for 5 minutes. B never showed up so I left. Honestly, I already gave up on the idea of getting the refund after getting home. It's just 60 bucks, took me over a month. It's really not worth the time and brain spent on it. The best thing I could do was writing this review so that hopefully others wouldn't make the same mistake, and maybe copy paste this review and send it to the corporate office. But B texted me at 8:19 PM. B said that he would bring me the check again but he would need to look at his schedule and let me know the next day. He said sorry again and I really believed this guy. The next day (Wednesday), B said he couldn't that day because he and his girl have a doctor's appointment about their baby. So I said the day after (Thursday) at 6:35 PM. I got off work at 6 and had a class at 7. He said yes.Thursday in the morning, I asked him to meet me on time since I had to go to class afterwards. He responded okay. At 6:25 PM, when I was at the place we were supposed to meet, these interesting messages from B showed up on my phone: ""Okay, so I was on the phone with my boss and there is nothing we can do about giving you your money back. I also told her about me telling you that I would pay you back [it's okay if you couldn't. Just say that. Why on earth did you keep making me wait?! I felt like a monkey] and I can't. I told her how you keep texting me and threatening me, telling me you will report me if you don't get paid. She told me that you are harassing me, which is true, and that you need to stop texting me. We can't pay you back because you had your membership longer than 7 days. You only have a 7-day cancellation. After that you can't get reimbursed. If you don't believe me, look at the contract you signed. It states it all there.""What I was angry about was after being tricked, waited and being tricked again, I was called threatening and harassing. I already gave up first time when he didn't show up since I've already been waiting for so long. I was exhausted. It was him who kept texting saying he wanted to help. To be honest, it's the first time in my life I was ever described like that - feeling offended. Lesson learned: NEVER LISTEN TO SALESPEOPLE. Look at the contract word by word, even when dealing with big names (e.g. LA FITNESS)."
1003,698438,2013-07-02,1,"The LA Fitness front desk workers are unfriendly and extremely bothersome. It is typical that most of the workers don't even say hello to the people they check in. Also, every time I try to check in, one of the workers in particular always asks to check my ID before I can enter. My family and I have had my membership for about 6 years now. Never did any of us have to deal with this problem. About 2 and a half years ago, I upgraded my membership so that each of us can bring in 2 people. This one particular worker continually makes my guests sign waivers and show ID before entering. Although that might be part of her job, she is the only person that does this. All the other workers allow each of us to go in without a 10-minute hassle. This might not be a big deal, but I usually only go to the gym 2 or 3 times a week for about 1 hour and 15 minutes each session. This cuts down my workout time and also causes problems for me, my guests, and the other people that want to check in. It has gotten to a point where when my husband and I were denied access into LA Fitness. Their excuse for our denied access is that our accounts were ""accidentally deleted."" I was extremely mad when they told us this because I knew without hesitation that they were lying about it because my son was still able to check in the next day! Some of these workers need to be replaced and LA Fitness needs to step it up because members including myself are switching out FAST!"
1004,698225,2013-07-01,1,"I signed up for a one-month training session and paid in full. I was told I could go month by month for the training rather than sign a yearly agreement. This guy was the manager and said he could change the contract, not to worry. He even gave me 2 free weeks. Well, the end of my training ended and I was to let him know if I was continuing. Well, he already had the next month taken from my account before any conversation took place. When I asked him about it, he back tracked and apologized profusely. One week went by and still no refund. I asked him again and he said he'd take care of it. One more week went by and still no money. When I spoke with him on a three-way call with corporate, he tried say it was a misunderstanding on my part. I was told that the additional month was taken out because I had used 2 weeks already. So, the two ""free"" sessions were, in fact, not free. Needless to say, I cancelled my membership and plan to tell everyone what a horrible place this is."
1005,696805,2013-06-25,1,"LA Fitness is a nightmare to deal with and their company should go bankrupt. I joined up for a Personal Trainer and used one for exactly seven weeks. I had to break the contract because of medical reasons which were sent to LA Fitness first by certified mail and second by a fax from a doctor's office. They claim they never received either even after the certified confirmation was scanned. I was at the Post Office today and was told that the confirmation signature is a legal document. After getting nowhere with LA Fitness, I called my credit card company for assistance. They contacted LA Fitness several times with no response. When I again called the customer service number for LA Fitness, I was told that they never received any letters from my credit card company. I have about six letters from my credit card company. In other words, they just out and out lie about everything. I think if perhaps I sued them, they might take lying and cheating to customers seriously. I have now blocked them from receiving any more money from my credit card. I think I should get a total refund of all monies given to LA Fitness for all the pain and suffering they put me through."
1006,694664,2013-06-17,1,"I signed a new membership just over 2 weeks ago. I was informed by the general manager of this gym (Watauga, Texas) that I had 30 days to fully evaluate my membership and cancel with a refund within that time frame. He told me this after I told him that I wanted to wait to sign up until after my next doctor's appointment for my severe osteoarthritis. He convinced me to sign at that time. My doctor informed me that I needed shoulder replacement and set up a surgery. I went in to my local gym to inform them that I needed to cancel my membership and get a full refund. The accounts lady just laughed at me. ""You know that there are no refunds for any reason. "" I asked to speak to the general manager that signed me up and she said that he was unavailable and out of town. She also told me that she would notify him and I could call back later in the week if I thought that would get me anything. I have never set foot in the gym except to sign up and cancel, not one single workout of any kind. I am angriest that they were amused and laughing at the situation. UNBELIEVABLE!!"
1007,693568,2013-06-13,1,"I had gone to the gym by my house and was interested in some personal training. When I spoke to the Personal Training Manager, he had informed me that the contract was the same as the regular membership contract; you can cancel at any time as long as you gave a 30-day notice. I was only interested in having a personal trainer for 3-6 months. When I went to cancel my personal training contract, I was informed that I had actually signed this contract for one year. Furthermore, if I wanted to cancel my contract, I would have to pay out my contract for 50% of my monthly cost, and that it would have to be paid at the time that I cancel my contract. I was having some money issues, and the costs were becoming increasingly difficult to pay, and I had missed some of my payments when they were due. When I was called by Membership Services, I was informed that because I have missed a payment, that I could not even use the sessions that I had already paid for. This is the first time I have ever had a personal trainer, and although, I like the trainers, trying to get an appointment for a session with my trainer was difficult at times. When I brought this up to Membership Services, they informed me that it was my responsibility to make my own appointments with my trainer. This is probably one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with, and I will never join a gym again!!!! "
1008,692133,2013-06-09,1,"I was with Bally's over 20 years when LA Fitness bought Bally's memberships. I was paying $98.00 yearly. They stated to me that my membership would be $161.00 yearly. This is clearly a case of price GOUGING. I have written letters to BBB as well as the DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE regarding my concerns. There has clearly been a form of ADA violation. I'm disabled, and they denied me access to their facility. I do have written statements from my physician regarding an order for me to have some form of exercise. Something needs to be done about these bad business practices!!! Next step: LEGAL CONSULTATION."
1009,690552,2013-06-04,1,"I was with Bally's over 15 years when LA Fitness took over. They breached the contract and committed fraud by trying to jack up what used to be $99 a year to $500. I'm sure they are doing the same to all the old Bally's customers. After many months of fighting and Bally's was in cahoots with LA Fitness, they won't send me my old contract. Now, I took them to court, won the judgement against LA Fitness/Pricilla ** manager. Now, they are not paying me. I'm much happier at 24-Hour Fitness. So people, you have been warned. Don't join sleazy Bally's and LA Fitness. It's time to put them out of business."
1010,689027,2013-05-30,1,"I have been a member of LA Fitness Morrow, Georgia for over five years, and as a loyal member, I am thoroughly disappointed and disgusted with the LA Fitness Center in Morrow, Georgia. Management and trainers should be FIRED for their LACK of professionalism and customer service which is absolutely ridiculous. I would like to draw your attention to several negative situations that have occurred over time. First of all, the class schedule/instructors change every month which is totally UNACCEPTABLE. When you get good instructors, you do whatever it takes to keep them. On top of that, you bring in a 350-lb. person to replace an instructor. What does that say to the class? She has no endurance and is a risk/threat to her own health and safety. That is not motivation to me. Second, the women's bathroom is always FILTHY and SMELLS. This is very hazardous and unsanitary. Third, the aerobics room is disgusting and also filthy. The floor has never been cleaned since the gym has been in existence. The room smells.This degradation of service is unfortunate because I greatly enjoy exercising at LA Fitness Morrow, Georgia. I would like to see some action taken to make the facility worth paying money to attend. I would like to see quality and fit instructors. Customers are paying for a service that they are not getting. LA Fitness changes the class schedule without notifying their customers. If you are going to change the schedules, you need to provide capable and fit instructors - ** is over 350 lbs. Now you tell me if that is motivation or an absolute shame. This would not happen at Camp Creek. Why does the Morrow location have to suffer or deal with this type of embarrassment?"
1011,686265,2013-05-21,1,"On 10/20/2012 I contacted LA Fitness customer service to cancel my wife’s monthly membership that I started when I purchased it at Bally Total Fitness ($19.99 per month). I called the local LA Fitness in Glendale Heights, Illinois to ask how I could cancel this. While looking my account up, Mike informed me that my membership was expired. I was shocked by this since 1) I was a member with Bally/Chicago Health Club since 1982, 2) because I paid my membership fee, and 3) because LA Fitness does not send out any sort of reminder that dues is due and your account will be expiring. I requested the number to the corporate office. On 10/23/2012 I spoke to Michelle ** at the Irvine, California office and was informed my membership had expired because I never visited an LA Fitness location since my membership was transferred over. Because I didn’t visit them within 90 days of the transfer, my membership had expired under the original terms. I was not informed of this clause in the contract. I did have a 90-day grace period from my expiration of 6/21/12 to 9/21/12. When I asked why I wasn’t contacted via email to pay my yearly dues (I set myself up on their website), I was told that LAF doesn’t send reminders when dues is due??? I was then told I could certainly sign up again for $199.99 per year (or what the going rate was then). Since I was paying $60 per year for my membership, I assumed this would continue. Bally would always send out reminder emails. I am upset. I see this as a way of LAF to weed out older contracts so they can keep their rates high.Thousands of people join health clubs and don’t attend. I was penalized because I didn’t visit a club. Because of this, I lost a membership I’ve had for 31 years. As I told Ms. **, it isn’t any of their business if I attend or not as long as I pay. Please help me."

After canceling, we still got charged for the next month; even though when we signed up, we prepaid for our last month to avoid this. They told us they would refund it. We changed our address with them in person because we had moved. We still didn't receive the check in the mail. We went by LA Fitness to make sure they had the correct address. They did not. We eventually had to do it ourselves online. We left several messages with our home club and no one ever called us back. We finally called corporate, but they were rude and didn't seem to want to help. The customer service at LA Fitness is horrible, and the gym sucks. The only reason I got a membership there is because I work at a very nice health club and wanted to be able to workout on my days off without seeing everyone I know. I didn't know this gym was going to suck so bad. The biggest waste of 30 bucks a month."

I simply explained I had cancelled my membership. It is obvious they are desperate for money. Five times since then at the club (mind you, it is only the 8th) I was harassed each time I entered about updating my credit card. No wonder people are leaving there in droves. They treat you like a common criminal. Too bad they couldn't be as quick to fix some things around the club just as quick!"
1016,682402,2013-05-07,2,"The whole LA Fitness experience is just a big frustration dealing with a corporate American company that doesn't care about the satisfaction of their customers, just get their money and ignore any concerns they have. I attend a greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area club. Complaint number 1: When I signed up for a membership in November of 2011, I got the usual, ""This is our club. These are our trainers. This is our program and these are our club hours."" Well, by the time June 2012 rolled along, they posted a sign on the front door stating, ""New summer hours on Sat and Sun would be 8am to 5pm."" The club to this point was open to 8pm Sat and Sun. I made my complaint to the GM and in a cocky, overconfident, ""I don't care what you think"" attitude, he stated that there is not enough people in the gym during the hours of 5pm to 8pm. He said that if you have a restaurant open and don't have enough customers to justify employees on hand, you have to close the doors. All fine if it's a restaurant but this is a club whose membership fees are collected whether or not people are in the gym or not. It doesn't matter if 1 person, 25 persons or 125 persons are in the gym. The club is still making their money. I asked for an adjustment on my dues then based on the fact that they eliminated over 24 hours monthly of gym availability per month, also showing him through records that I highly frequented the hours on Sat and Sun in question when he laughed it off and told me it would only be through the summer and I could call the corporate office if I wanted to. Summer passed and hours never were changed back.Many people work on Sat and/or Sun and only have opportunity to work out on the weekend during the what was once available evening hours. It's a shame that one has to get up a several hundred-member petition and threaten to cancel membership in order to get management to do the things that members want in their club. Does anybody remember what happened to Netflix when they jacked their customers around? They answered with their pocket books. I was going to post another complaint but don't want to make this one into a book I will complain about the high pressure harassment tactics for training contracts on another day."
1017,682396,2013-05-07,2,"While some theft from unlocked lockers is not unexpected, LA Fitness Buford, GA has no cameras anywhere. They have a lax policy of letting guests in and recently, this resulted in a massive theft of wallets, keys, gym bags, cell phones and other valuables from locked lockers. The theft ring hung around in gym clothes and waited until victims were showering then cut the lock off their locker while someone else was a lookout. A $400 security system from Costco would have nailed these guys but LA Fitness is too cheap to monitor for bad guys. So now, LA Fitness will be responsible for ID theft, stolen cars, burglary of homes where keys and driver's licenses can be paired and used to break into homes, etc. Thanks, LAF. You're boneheads."
1018,680462,2013-04-30,1,"I had an Urban Active family membership. LA Fitness established memberships for my kids for $7 per month but told me I would have to pay $30 a month like I was a new member. I have called and sent paperwork to corporate, left messages with District Manager Mike ** and District Operations Manager Justin ** and no one has even returned a call! Originally, they tried to say it was an Urban Active mix-up. However, Urban Active has responded to my email and sent over my paperwork. Why would LA Fitness think it is okay to treat a customer in this manner? How is it that you give a discount to those who were not financially responsible for the account?! Unbelievable!"
1019,680114,2013-04-29,1,"I've been paying for LA Fitness membership for years. I also pay for my wife and daughter. I pay a little over $70 a month for the two memberships and the kid's club. I've become accustomed to the poor customer service LA Fitness offers. I enjoy a short 20-minute to 40-minute workout. I have clocks in my home. I have a clock in the car. I have a clock on my cell phone. There are clocks on the walls in LA Fitness. I know what the club hours are. The front desk people always love to ask me, ""Do you know what time it is?"" Of course, I know what time it is. Why do they need to ask me if I know what time it is? Are they trying to detour me from working out? I find it very rude! Sometimes when they are not quite so rude, they inform me ""the club closes at 8,"" ""the club closes at 11,"" ""the kid's club closes at 12,"" ""you have 45 minutes."" Thank you, I know what time it is. I know when you close and I plan on going home before you close! At least sometimes they are just informing me rather than insulting my intelligence, ""Do you know what time it is!?"" Today, Sunday, April 28th, 2013, I was visiting my grandmother in Allen, Texas. My wife and daughter stayed home with my grandmother. I left my grandmother's home in Allen just a little after 7:00PM CDT. I arrived at LA Fitness 6101 K Ave Plano, TX 75074. The guy at the front desk, who he claimed was the sales manager (and his first name is supposedly **? Another employee referred to him by **), informed me when I walked in the club, ""Just so you know, you only have 30 minutes. We close at 8:00."" I replied ""I know,"" scanned my LA Fitness tag ** and proceeded to the locker room. I was in the middle of changing when **, the sales manager, interrupted me so he can hassle me for my La Fitness key tag **. He took a picture of it with his cellphone, then handed the key tag back to me. Before I handed the key tag to **, I let him know that ""The gym closes at 8:00. So if you're going to hassle me for my key tag after I already checked in and interrupted my 30-minute workout, then don't come hassle me again to leave when I am finishing up my shower and it happens to be 8:02PM."" Joe said he wouldn't hassle me anymore. I then went on to swim a couple laps in the swimming pool. Next, I hopped in the sauna room to sweat a little. Keep in mind that while you work out or swim and afterwards step in the Sauna, your blood pressure is elevated. I was perfectly relaxed enjoying my time sitting in the hot sauna when another LA Fitness employee came inside the sauna where I was listening to music on my headphones.I took the headphones out of my ears so I can hear what this guy is bothering me about. He told me ** needs to see me at the front desk. I replied, ""Tell ** to come see me if he needs to talk to me. It's 7:53 and I only have 7 minutes left."" The employee said, ""No, I need you to come to the front."" I replied again, ""** already hassled me once and said he wouldn't hassle me again. If he wants to talk to me, tell him to come see me."" By this time, my arms felt like there was electricity running through them. I was pretty outraged by the harassment I was receiving. I decided it is time to hop out of the sauna and take a quick shower. After drying off and getting dressed, I walked back into the main area of the gym to leave. The employee who bothered me in the sauna yelled over to **, ""Here he comes!""I was bothered by this too so I walked over to **'s desk and asked him for some credentials. He replied, ""I don't have to show you anything."" I said back, ""Well, tell me your first and last name."" He replied, ""I don't have to tell you anything."" He then went on to tell me I was stealing some ladies' membership and that he was going to call the police. I replied back, ""Whose membership am I stealing? My wife's? I pay for that membership as I do mine and my daughters. Call the police if you want so they can see what kind of business you are running and I will have more reason to complain about harassment to the corporate office when I call tomorrow.""I walked outside the club, entered my car and the second I left the parking lot, I had two Plano Police Department SUVs pull me over to add to all my harassment and trauma I'd already received. Luckily, the officers were kind and patient. They took my LA Fitness key tag ** and went back to the gym with it while they delayed me from the rest of my evening. Finally, after being interrogated and asked to have my car searched, the Plano police officers said they couldn't see anything wrong and said they were sorry to bother me. Officer Miles (badge #**) scribbled on a piece of paper this number for me **. Officer Miles said there wouldn't be a report, but this is some kind of reference number in case all the above needs to be verified by the police. I got on the internet after I got home to look for LA Fitness' corporate phone number. I found thousands of customer complaints about the company including this suggestive sex lawsuit ** at another Plano, TX LA Fitness. What is wrong with this company? Whatever happened to customer service? Who hired this **, sales manager? I would be embarrassed to have him as an employee of my company. Is there retribution for LA Fitness and employees of LA Fitness?"
1020,680091,2013-04-29,1,"I signed up for LA Fitness in the Atlanta area and was completely horrified by their billing practices. For a couple months, I used the gym with no issue but then decided that the gym was no longer for me. I called to cancel my account and was told I was not allowed to cancel my account over the phone. After some wheeling and dealing with the agent on the phone, she agreed to close my account. To my surprise, I checked my bank account a month later, which I did not use regularly because I had a different account as my main. It was overdrawn by $2,100. LA Fitness tried to debit my account over 70 times and my bank kept piling on NSF charges. Of course, they took no responsibility nor did they care about my overdrawn account. I eventually talked my bank into not charging me the money. They permanently blocked LA Fitness from charging me and gave me a new account number. Before I asked my bank to change my account, I asked LA Fitness to stop debiting my account and they said they would not. It was the craziest experience of my life. Do not give them your bank account info - only use a credit card."
1021,679804,2013-04-27,1,"I agree with the other negative comments posted about LA Fitness and on top of all that, all they want is your money. What a pressure sell and I didn't realize it until it was too late. I recommend/suggest that you investigate any and all other available fitness centers before you sign any contract documents with LA Fitness"". I cannot wait for my 1 year to be up - I will not be going back there. I am a senior citizen who wants to regain my strength and fitness and LA Fitness caters to lunks? The ""trainer"" they gave me is a 23-year-old jock. It is not working out very well and she tries to assign me activities that would actually cause injuries? I am 100% dissatisfied."
1022,679754,2013-04-27,1,"I went to my LA Fitness on April 24th, which is located in East Brunswick, New Jersey. I arrived at 3 pm, spent 1.5 hours doing cardio and proceeded on weights. I did upper body work out. I felt great and proceeded to the locker room. Well, today my perfect day was disrupted because upon opening my locker, I found the locker empty: I was robbed! I went to the front desk and was told that five other people had also been robbed. I was the sixth person today. I was a lucky ** today. The police was called. The other gentleman who also had been robbed (I do not know if he was the fifth or the seventh) and I waited for the police to arrive. The officer tore a piece of paper and took my information, then gave me my # ** on this torn piece of paper and went on his way. I had an ordeal today. I finally got home. I went to the Robert Wood Johnson Fitness Center website and I will certainly be their next new member."
1023,679684,2013-04-26,2,"I'm really upset because LA Fitness won't reinstate my cancelled account. I had previously been unemployed for the past eight months and had to make some financial decisions; mainly just stick with car, insurance and cell phone bills. Everything else dropped out of necessity. I've explained this to three different people and nobody cares. Why?"
1024,678866,2013-04-24,1,"LA Fitness personal training program is a scam. It causes damage to your health, misinforms customers and charges account when membership is canceled. It is a lie. They pretend to be your personal trainer when they sell the membership. We joined the LA Fitness signature club in Port Chester, NY before construction was done. Then my husband and I joined in the second day that it opened with a personal trainer and the contract was made with Andrew **. He told us that we won't have any problems as we could freeze the account or put the account on hold and we could take the training together. We took two classes with PT Stanley. However, after these two classes, Stanley was not allowed by the management to give us more gym classes, so we had to wait about three weeks for new employees were hired and then continue with our classes. Moreover, they did not stop to take the money from our account, so it accumulated the classes. After I restarted the training classes, I found out I was pregnant and immediately informed my personal trainer (Renato) and the administration about it. They (administration, Andrew) told me they would cancel my account but that did not happen. I went back again and talked to the person responsible and he told me I had to have a medical certificate stating about my pregnancy risk. I showed them the medical certificate but they still continued charging my account. I returned numerous times to try to solve the problem; however, it was never solved. I have accumulated 91 classes which I had paid and they still want to charge me over $1,200 because I canceled my bank account for them so they could not withdraw more money from it. I asked for some paper that proved that I have the classes accumulation and I was there trying to resolve the problem, but nobody gave me anything. However, my debt kept growing because they never cancelled or even freeze my account. They only ask me for a new paper every time I go there to try any solution. However, I never got any proof and they asked me for a new document so that it is impossible to cancel my contract that day. And the days go by and they still steal more money from me. The last time I was at the gym (4/19/2013), I felt very offended by the neglect of those responsible (Justin and Adrew). I'm already in the eighth month of pregnancy and cannot solve this problem. I have medical certificate saying that I am not allowed to do physical exercises as they are a pregnancy risk. I did everything they asked me and nothing was resolved. They lied when they made the contract, not complied with the agreement, caused me problems in my bank account and I felt that I was extorted (stolen from) by them."
1025,678854,2013-04-24,1,"I was appalled to find out that LA Fitness will take no responsibility for a serious injury which resulted in a broken femur and partial hip replacement. I was told by customer service that LA Fitness is not responsible and will not cover the medical expenses for an injury that occurred at their gym because of a black greasy substance on the bathroom tile floor. My poor mom is in the hospital and will need to be transferred to a rehabilitation center and will most likely be there between 23 and 31 days. I cannot believe that not only did the paramedics take her away but not a single phone call from an LA Fitness representative was made to call and check on my mom, their member since 2001. Incredible! Then I'm told all they can offer is to freeze her membership. Well, no duh. She has a 6-month road to recovery ahead of her. There is no way she can use her membership! That's the least you can do! I thought it was only fair for LA Fitness to cover the hospital, ambulance and rehab facility bills. My gosh! I got a flat no! I guess I need to take this to an attorney. I've never had a lawsuit, never wanted to do anything like this in my life but this is the wrong thing to say to someone when they have had a serious injury!"
1026,678774,2013-04-23,1,"Last night, I went to the Canoga Club with the guest pass and I wanted to work out so I went to the sales manager randomly and asked him if I could go in. He started to talk about the club which is normal and asked me to join the club. I told him that I was already a member of another club. Guess what happened?! They kicked me out of the club! I went out and tried to call the club and talk to the manager but the same guy picked up and he didn't let me talk to his manager! What a shame!"
1027,678570,2013-04-23,1,"It is a constant recurring thing with this gym. Nothing is maintained correctly. The spa, sauna and steam room don't work. The hooks are broken in the shower stalls. There are sewer flies everywhere. I have actively began telling other members this email address and I will make sure I tell everyone that LA Fitness is a very nasty club along with the fact that the club doesn't get maintained. I am a very active Facebook user too. I can spread the word really fast that this gym is developing a bad relationship. I don't want to waste my energy. I just want a gym that functions."
1028,677741,2013-04-19,1,"I just moved from Canada to Irvine, California and my brother-in-law, who lives in Irvine and has LA Fitness family membership, asked me to go to the gym with him. He said this company is different and they respect the members and their guests. He can take me as a guest for an hour to see if I like it so I can join the LA Fitness. Before we went there, we had a good discussion about business in general. I had told him it is impossible they let me in without charging as for the majority of business owners, the only important thing is money and not customers. My brother-in-law did not accept my opinion and said LA Fitness is a huge reputable company that is very different from other businesses, and he was sure that I can use the gym for an hour as his guest and free of charge. Just the end of the story, the staff was insisting to get a short-term membership for $30-40 or pay a $15 daily fee for an hour fitness usage and I had to pay it. I wish you could see my brother-in-law's face when I told him ""Man! Another business! Are you really that naive to believe that they do care about the customers and not money?"" I was laughing and my poor brother-in-law was very upset the whole day."
1029,676137,2013-04-12,1,"This is hands down the worst customer service I've ever had from a place that I pay to use. The staff is both rude and incompetent when it comes to doing their jobs. I've repeatedly had billing issues since they bought out Urban Active here in Columbus. Every month, it seems like I'm being double billed, paying for something I have canceled, or just having a random charge taken out of my account. I have had to resort to watching my bank account like a hawk when it comes to them. I have no problem with the gym itself, but the staff is another story. I don't come to you with a problem and expect to deal with a snotty attitude or excuses about why you can't do this or that. There is one person who deals with billing issues and they are never there? Oh how convenient! The only way it seems to get handled is if you make a fuss which, the snotty blonde girl who all but rolled her eyes at me, seemed to not get the fact that I pay to use the club, not put up with her attitude. If I have an issue, fix it. They will give you a headache with all the billing issues, make you wait over a week for the money to be returned to your account, and not compensate you at all for the inconvenience. I will be canceling my membership as soon as I use up my personal training credits. Though I like the gym, it's absolutely not worth it to deal with such a rude staff and a company that can't handle my credit information properly. There are entirely too many alternatives and I plan to take my business to one of them!"
1030,674826,2013-04-05,2,"I signed up for a three-month membership which I paid cash in full specifically asking that I would be able to access the other locations in my area with this membership. I was reassured twice by two different people that I would. When I went to use the other gyms, I was told I could not unless I paid an extra $50. All I want is to be given what I was told. So much for honesty and integrity these days. I'm greatly saddened and disappointed."
1031,674074,2013-04-03,1,"I just wanted to say that the gym of 75th Ave. and Thomas Road is in poor condition - many equipment malfunctions; and the company is always prompt in gaining bankcards, and I think changed me to another gym nearby called Planet Fitness."
1032,673567,2013-04-01,1,"I went to the nearest Bally's to me, which was about one mile away. In November of 2011, they switched over to being an LA Fitness. I didn't mind the switch since they honored my Bally's Personal Fitness sessions. When it came time to buy a new package around April, I bought a 12-month one. Then bam, the club closed one month later at the end of May. Turns out they closed all the clubs by me as well, making the closest one 10 miles away from me. When I googled the directions for the new club, it was about 10.5 miles away from me. So given this, I called them to cancel both my membership and my personal training contract. I was told that because I was right around that 10-mile distance away from the nearest club, they would most likely cancel my personal training contract. He told me to go ahead and put everything in writing and submit my request. I put everything in writing, requested my membership and contract be cancelled and that any refunds due to me because of the gym closure on my prepaid membership be credited to my credit card used for the monthly payments. I also indicated they confirm with me in writing that all was done. Well weeks, then months went by with no word, so I sent them another letter. Then another one when a couple of weeks had gone by. When I called again, the lady told me that because I wasn't outside the 10-mile distance, I could not cancel my policy. But she would do me a favor and let me buy out the rest of my contract for half of what I still owed. When I said no, she said I'd have to pay it until the contract expired, so I said fine. At this point, I was so annoyed with them that I just let it go. Well I have recently discovered that they never stopped the payments so I've been paying month to month! What the heck! I went online to stop this and get this, they told me that my membership was cancelled so I couldn't log in. So why is it that if my membership is cancelled, that they would continue to take my money? It's crappy enough that I felt like they hoodwinked me by signing me up for a contract one month before they closed the gym and then not letting me get out of it. Then when they used the whole 10 miles excuse, it rubbed me the wrong way. Then to continue taking my money even when my membership was cancelled? Really, is this good business practice?"
1033,671248,2013-03-22,1,"The New Hyde Park, NY club manager, Denis, and his employees were extremely rude to me today and refused to help me locate my personal belongings after I had forgotten the locker box where I had deposited my stuff. I showed them the general area, but they started giving me a hard time. They told me that they were only going look at a few boxes, and were utterly nasty the whole time. I can't believe these guys. They behaved like bums and refused to help. I am going to see my attorney on this. Has anybody else had similar experience?"
1034,670677,2013-03-20,1,"I belong to the LA Fitness in Bridgeville, PA and all I can say is they have triple oversold membership subscriptions for what they offer. In the last six months or more, the facility has become incredibly congested. It is like Chicago's O'Hare Airport at 6:00pm on a Friday. The wait to use cardio equipment: whether it's treadmills, stair steppers or ellipticals, you can bet that you will be waiting and not exercising as you thought you would be as you gave them your credit card. In the spinning class, we have had broken speakers for music. And we have had weeks going without a microphone for the instructor to lead us in our spinning class. It is frustrating and I don't think the ownership cares. They just keep bringing more and more people in at the cheaper rates; but if they don't maintain what they have, they will end of just like Bally’s. In fact the Bally’s they took over in Bethel Park, they have not done anything to but slap their name on the front of it. It is as filthy as it was when Bally’s owned it.My last complaint is the way LA Fitness will have vendors such as pizza parlors and sub shops giving food to people inside the gym next to the machines in the midst of dripping sweat and heat. It is disgusting and especially nauseating after you are working out to smell the odors of food. But hey workout and then pig out! Anything for a buck or a name."
1035,669110,2013-03-13,3,"I like LA Fitness in Euless, TX, but there are a couple improvements I think they need. I could not find anything for feedback on their website so here goes. First, there doesn't seem to be anyone in charge. The ring around the pool is disgusting. If it were your bathtub, you would clean it. Why does management let this go there? I have informed them twice. The first time I got an argument that red buildup was normal with Euless water. But there is black and fungus as well. I personally think any buildup, whatever the color, is worth cleaning off. The pool guy cleaned the sides when he was first hired and never again since. It's just common sense to keep it clean. That's what you pay him for. Then today, the repair guy’s vehicle in the gym started beeping for no reason. It was sitting unattended, yet no one there though anything about letting the noise reverberate throughout the gym disturbing everyone's peace for an indefinite amount of time. I mentioned it to some people at the desk and they gave me a dumb excuse, yet there was no logical reason for everyone to suffer. So finally one of them turned it off. Then later on it started again, yet no one there bothered to address it again. I mentioned it as I was leaving and the guy just looked away, like it wasn't his problem. Those people are way too young to be running a gym. Where is the adult in charge? I am only asking for common sense to be used. This is not demanding.Also, the music is way too loud, and I don't like what is playing. The girls' dressing room is the worst. No one likes it. I have to wear ear plugs and use my iPhone, which is hard to do when changing clothes and bathing. One more complaint, please get those covers over the vents on the ceiling near the Jacuzzi. Stink is coming out of them and it's stomach retching. The other people there thought it was coming out of the pool filters! But the problem is in the ceiling. Other than that, I like the gym but more logic in managing the facility is necessary."
1036,669025,2013-03-13,1,"I joined LA fitness in November 2012. Since then, I have been overbilled for what they told me was a family account. Somewhere along the lines, their billing department or salesperson decided to change my account to an individual account; three at that. I have called various times and no one has an answer. I was threatened by the manager and was told to cancel the account. I decided that enough was enough. I called last week and spoke to their Affairs Department. The lady I talk to at ** stated that they didn't charge me. I said, “Yes you did because I have over $400 from last month just on NSF fees, and now that it’s canceled.” I have an additional $300 of NSF due to their constant hit. I chose to cancel my bank account and submitted a fraud form on my behalf through my bank and have advised the Better Business Bureau and the District Attorney's Office for fraudulent charges. I should have stayed at 24 hour fitness. They offer so much better service, and I never had a problem with billing."
1037,666887,2013-03-05,1,"My new L.A. Fitness opened about 4 months ago. They have plenty of nautilus style machines but can't seem to keep the three swiss balls they have inflated. Often the machines are sweaty, and to make matters worse, there are no available gym towels. The staff hard sells worse than a used car salesman, so much so I have had to get rude just to get them to back off. My personal trainer is completely inept and ignorant, fails to show up repeatedly, and does not seem to be able to comprehend even the most basic concepts of fitness. Though the trainer is ""technically"" not part of L.A. fitness, he works for their parent company, wears the L.A. Fitness logo, and is overseen by the person who helped me sign up with the club. The staff has been uninterested in attending to anything I have asked for, and when asking for information on pricing to sign up my girlfriend (who lives with me), I was told flat out they didn't have time to discuss it unless she came up there. They literally would not give me the most basic info on adding her to my contract without her present. Mostly I just don't get the impression anyone gives a crap about me and I won't re-up."
1038,665330,2013-03-03,1,"Okay, this really upsets me. 90% of the Zumba classes at all 6 locations around me claim that their classes are Zumba and they are not! Why lie? All it does is inconvenience me. I drive there expecting to Zumba and it's Latin heat. Talking about misleading. There are only 2 instructors that teach Zumba. The other 20 teach Latin heat claiming it is Zumba. The same goes with yoga. Yoga is stretching and 7 out of 10 instructors do Pilates claiming it's yoga. What is this about? Stop lying and get it together. If the class is Latin heat, then state that it is Latin heat. If you don't know the difference, then research it. Same goes for the yoga. If the class is Pilates, then say it's Pilates because I am tired of being misled. I would like to know what to expect. Southern California, by the way."
1039,659563,2013-02-21,1,"They are scam artists. After I signed up for the club membership, they decided to sign me up 2 weeks later for personal training without my consent. They even sent me an email confirmation for the personal training 2 weeks after the membership enrollment email confirmation. The personal training contract they sent didn't have my signature or initials but someone else's. They had my card info from my membership draft and drafted $399 out for personal training for 12 sessions and then wanted to draft $300 every month there after for 12 months - totaling $3,999.00. I never agreed to anything like that. I went in the next day and they said they couldn't cancel the contract. No apologies or anything. A little strange since this is an illegitimate contract that I never signed up or authorized. They tried to offer me all types of things to get me to go along with their scam, extra sessions and freezes etc. I thought about it for all of 30 minutes before I completely got disgusted and decided that I no longer want anything else to do with those dishonest people."

We know LA Fitness is coming, but they're still taking out my money from my account even after I called for the cancellation. They said they charged the last charge. The surprise is my son's tendon program is no longer there anymore but they're still charging me. Nobody tried to contact me. They have my address, my phone no. and my email. Nothing has changed. And when I called them, they never treat me right. It is so sad."
1041,654162,2013-02-01,1,"I'm extremely pissed off. This was my first gym membership. I have no complaints about the gym or the price for the gym membership, but I have a huge complaint about the personal trainer option. After the first free personal trainer session, me and my friend were told by the sales guy about the price for joining the PT program and about a 6-month training option without mentioning any type of commitment or term agreements. He told me the price per month and the down payment amount. I said sure, and we talked about testing it out for a couple sessions, and then if we don’t like it, we can cancel the trainer. He agreed that it was a good idea, still not mentioning term agreements or the fact that it was actually for 12 months and not six. So, I leave to go to the lockers to retrieve my debit card. When I returned, he took down my card information and said thanks. Unbeknownst to me, during my trip to the lockers to retrieve my card, this guy allowed someone else to sign the contract! I didn't know until I received an email with a one page contract attached with someone else's signature, and there were no initials next to where the term agreements are supposed to be listed. Of course it didn't list that I would be charged for 12 months. I’ve never seen a contract before the billing started, and the contract was emailed to me. I followed the steps to cancel the contract, but received an email stating that I'm committed for 12 months - over $200 a month. I'm confused and very, very, upset that a large and well known company would be allowed to stay in business while ripping people off this way. I filed a BBB complaint weeks ago. Now, they're up to over a thousand dollars in unused PT charges from my bank account. I'm trying to handle this in a professional way, but it seems I'll have to make some calls to a law firm and file a complaint with the courts. More money out of my pocket for a contract I never signed!"
1042,649446,2013-01-27,1,"I renewed my annual one year membership. The system indicated my renewal expired in 10 months, not 12 months. I asked the manager to correct the situation or prorate the cost to 10 months. He said he couldn't do either but the membership was still a good deal. I asked to cancel the membership - he advised it was cancelled. It was an outright lie. They never cancelled the transaction and refuse to respond to my requests. Avoid LA Fitness at all costs. The Falls Church, VA location was formerly a Bally's. This is deceptive sales."

I am completely disgusted in the way LA Fitness has treated a paying customer whose locker was broken into. How do you do business this way? My valuables were locked in my locker with a combination lock that I purchased. I come back to see my locker completely broken and all of my items gone: phone, credit card, ID, car keys, even my jacket and scarf. I understand you lock your items at your own risk but it's one thing if my lock was broken and it's another thing when the locker itself is held together by 1/4 screws that can be easily ripped out, and this is exactly what happened. I went to the front desk to ask the manager for help and he told me I need to wait. I picked up the front desk phone myself to call the police, as clearly, the manager couldn't be bothered. I checked this entire gym 6 times over. My items are gone. The police asked to see camera footage because all they had to see was a person walking out with my bag of belongings and a coat and easily looked them up since they have to scan in to get in. And right there, we would've had the person's full name, address and phone number. But guess what? LA Fitness has not a single camera in the entire facility, not even at the front door. Luckily, my car is still in the parking lot. The cops arrived and I happen to have the Find my iPhone app installed. The cop tracked the phone to be about a mile away. Long story short, we found that the GPS was faulty on this app and the phone was still in the building somewhere. (I was the one that figured this fault out).We figure this out after three Suffolk County Police Officers are out in 12-degree weather searching through backyards and houses for my personal belongings. They came back with nothing. So I checked every single storage closet, kids' club, bathroom I could, still nothing. I went back into the locker room a final time with the front desk girl's phone while I'm logged onto the Find my iPhone app. There's an option where you can make the phone make a noise, so I click it and I hear ringing. The ringing takes me to a locker in another section with someone else's lock on it. I run to the front desk, they grabbed the bow cutters, and cut the lock open, and all of my stuff is in there. Now some of you may see this as a happy ending, which yes, it is. However, let’s look at it from another point of view: What if I never had this app loaded onto my phone and the police and I gave up on this search.This person broke into my locker because of the poorly constructed LA Fitness locker was a piece of garbage, moved my stuff, put their own lock on it to come back to it at a later time. They do a drive by in the parking lot early this morning or late last night to find one car in the parking lot still there. Clearly, the Nissan keys in the belongings they stole match this car. They come back to the gym, open it up, take my entire life with them, and then take my car. Now they have my car, my ID with my address, and the keys to the front door of my house. I called a customer service rep and all they can extend is an apology and offer to freeze my account for free until I feel safe. How could I feel safe? I feel violated. You provide garbage lockers that can easily be broken into by a female who just waltzes in and takes my stuff. You don't have a single camera in the facility to catch a thief. Anyone could walk inside with a concealed weapon and get away with it.And with all of these shootings lately, how could anyone feel safe? And for the manager not to give a crap about this and go home in the middle of this, are you kidding me? Please share this with every LA Fitness member you know. Theft has been a huge issue in all long Island LA Fitness and nothing is being done about it. LA Fitness has done nothing but apologize and their argument is since I found my stuff in the end, everything is okay. However, it was this amazing app that found it. And if it wasn't for the garbage lockers, this would've never happened in the first place. Absolutely acceptable!"
1044,648676,2013-01-24,1,"I just want a manager who is fair to explain to me if I have never been billed, emailed or contacted by LA Fitness and have been a Bally's member for over 25 years, why I would stop paying my bill. It's insane and not fair that no one at LA Fitness has time to listen to me. I went and worked out and only when I inquired about my bill was told it's in a non-payment status. When I said I will pay like I have for over 25 years, I was told the supervisors are busy now but, ""get a doctor's note and you should be all good."" What is that all about?! The club is great, not the managing or billing."
1045,647250,2013-01-18,1,"I've been a member for over two years. I teach classes at LA Fitness as well, so what I'm about to say shocked even me. I was in LA fitness Dobson and Warner in Chandler, AZ today. I saw a student form one of my classes and I said hi. We began talking while we were both starting our workouts. I hadn't seen him in a while and I was like let's workout together. We were working out by the weights, laughing at all the men grunting and screaming as they lifted heavy weights. We were both doing the same machines because it's busy at the time we went. I had told him to watch the clock for me so I knew when 15 seconds was up. Well that's when I was called out by a man who worked there who said, ""You can't coach or train people. This is your warning. I know what I heard you say."" I said politely, ""I wasn't and please don't make assumptions."" The man who was speaking to me told me he was the manager and that he was going to ask me to leave. My friend said that people even at his place of employment had big egos when they were in high positions such as manager, so not to pay him any attention because we were just supporting one another in our workouts. Well we decided to not talk, figuring he didn't want us counting out load or something. But this man insisted to push away. I tried to shake it off by sitting in the sauna and pool. But it really upsets me that it happened in the first place. I run into people all the time at the gym that have workout partners and I was told today that I am not allowed, and if I wanted to I need to purchase training.I am currently writing a letter to my immediate supervisor and sending letters off to corporate to discuss this new policy that I am not aware of. But honestly, I was singled out because I am not a big fellow lifting big weights, I wear prayer beads and am of dark complexion. But basically, this guy didn't want me to talk at all and it's a shame because I come to the same gym with my mother. We talk, we work out and I always help her."
1046,646286,2013-01-14,2,"I contacted LA Fitness after the company I had worked for over fifteen years had decided to close the doors due to the economy. After reviewing the household expenses, it was determined that there was no money leftover in the monthly budget for a full gym membership and it would have to be downsized until I became employed again. I explained my situation, and that I needed to downsize my current $180 monthly membership down to a more manageable membership until I found a new job and had steady income coming in again. The receptionist and account specialist said I didn’t have that option. I explained that when I joined, I was employed and could verify that my employer had closed their doors and filed for bankruptcy and I currently had no income. They told me I could buy-out the remaining portion of the contract for $900 and if not, it would be reported as a default.Again, I explained I wasn’t requesting to cancel my contract, just that I needed to downgrade my membership services to the bare minimum to revise the current terms until I became employed again and could resume the previous membership level. Management said they could not do that. The cancellation or buy-out fees are ridiculous, especially when someone has lost his job. LA Fitness should be ashamed that they could not be flexible during such a difficult time for myself & my family."
1047,646105,2013-01-13,1,Their horrible cancellation policy which requires you to mail in your cancellation form is just ridiculous. They take years to actually cancel your membership and end up sucking an extra month of membership out of you. My gym got bought out by LA Fitness which is a shame because LA is the absolute worst gym available in every aspect.
1048,646062,2013-01-13,1,"I would like to make a complaint to LA Fitness about the way I was treated at LA Fitness Redondo, WA. My friend gave me a ticket to attend a Zumba class but when I tried to get in, Yasmine, the worker from the front desk, screamed at me from the front door telling me to get out. I just thought that she should talk to me better than that because it was disrespectful."
1049,646059,2013-01-13,1,"I have been receiving a dozens of phone calls throughout the past week to come to LA fitness in San Bernardino, by a salesperson named Catherin, to activate my sports free week pass. I already have a membership in Drayson Center, which is the Loma Linda Univ. Gym. However, I was considering joining a new fitness club, because Drayson closes early on Fridays and Saturdays. I work out 6 days a week, I am a certified personal trainer, professional Rugby player and a Masters in Nutrition student at Loma Linda Univ. I have been working out regularly for the past probably 7-8 years and I don't think I will stop anytime soon, which makes me a very valuable long-term customer to any fitness club. Today, I had a horrible experience at LA Fitness in San Bernardino. I called in yesterday at 7:30, which is my scheduled time, and asked to postpone my appointment 30 minutes. The receptionist told me that the person I was scheduled to meet with already left, and she couldn't do anything for me. I told her I would like to activate my free pass today. She said that wouldn't be possible because she was just a receptionist and she didn't know what to tell me. Anyways, I showed up the next day, which is today. I met Catherin, she told me that it would take 10 minutes to activate the thing. After running me through a fitness test, and a describing me the amazing features LA Fitness gym has, which I asked her to skip, she told me, “Let’s discuss our options here,” and gave me rates that were way higher than the one I already found on the Internet. I told her, I have to have my week free pass first and then after that week, I will tell her my decisions.She said, “How much are you willing to pay for a membership?” I told her 60 dollars with no initial fees - the deal that I found on the Internet. She gave me a down look, like my offer was very low compared to the amazing service that I am about to get. She told me she would ask her manager and get back to me. Then I found a lady - the manager - who didn't discuss any of my fitness plan, motivation, etc. Instead she went directly to negotiation about how much money she could generate out of me. I explained that I was not willing to be a member unless I try it first. Finally she asked me for my free pass, I told her I didn't have a document or a flyer written on it free pass, I just received the phone call. She told me she would check and get back to me. She sent me Catherin again - the person who called me. She told me that she couldn't find my name on the system, and that I didn't have a week free pass.However, her manager gave me permission to work out now for free, like they were doing me a favor. I felt so humiliated and disgusted by the unprofessional handling of the customers. If this is how you treat your new customers and how you promote fitness services at LA Fitness, only God knows how you treat your customers - something I never want to deal with never again. I also felt so bad for wasting my time and stopping by to be humiliated. After that I went straight to 24 Fitness, where I found good hospitality, friendly attitude, professional customer service and 24 hours service. I settled down a year plan with them. Like I mentioned before, I am a Masters in Nutrition student, I am a certified personal trainer, I am a physical exercise counselor and advisor and I will never refer LA Fitness to anyone."
1050,645587,2013-01-11,1,"My nephew, who was visiting me from Florida, invited me to attend LA Fitness as his friend pass. As we both entered the Staten Island location, the front desk guy, Mike, ignored us from the start, walked over to another employee and then came back. As my nephew handed over his pass, he scanned it and told my nephew he was not allowed to enter, as well as me. When my nephew asked why, he did not explain the reason why or offered to let us know about other options as a member. He then called an employee by the name of Justin who briefly with no interest or concern whatsoever told us what the situation was and ran off without letting me know what were some of my other options. I have worked in the retail industry for years and have faced many challenges with customers and never in my life as a consumer experience the worst customer service experience. It was clear they knew I was not a regular member and instead of inviting me in or speaking to me about my options, they quickly blew me off and my nephew. It is for this reason that I will never set foot into an LA Fitness in my life, especially the Staten Island location. The front desk person is the first person and the last person you see when visiting your location and how dare you hire incompetent associates like Mike and Justin. It says a lot about your company."
1051,645173,2013-01-09,1,"I just received a call from my 72-year-old mother who recently joined and had decided to take my niece, her 19-year-old granddaughter, to the gym while she was home from school on the 3-day pass they gave her. When they checked in, my mother was informed that a 3-day pass would require an advance notice and processing but they could “fast-track” her request for a $15 fee, stating that this was a new policy and that they would not make the exception. They requested to speak with the manager and asked if the fee could be waived since she was not aware of the change or had been informed any changes. She would have paid it but did not bring her wallet to the gym. They simply said no. Poor customer service! Seems like LA Fitness has culture problem with their management, and they don't seem to care about their customers/ members."
1052,645145,2013-01-09,1,"The air conditioner is not working for over a month in the club where I go to 3 times a week. When I asked, they said it will be repaired next week. Also, the personnel in the front desk, they are not pleasant as the other personnel when the club belongs to Bally. The club where I go to is located in Coral Way and 33rd Street in Miami. I hope you people take care of this big problem."
1053,644941,2013-01-08,1,"I have a buddy who warned me about getting MRSA both at the Lantana and Wellington LA Fitness Clubs. Within 90 days, I contracted MRSA and there was a couple there who had issues about all the people that train there that are sick. They have caught the flu there many times until they changed gyms. I have seen them since at Publix, and they said getting away from that meat market was the best move they ever made. I am very tired of the staff at both of these establishments for the lack of TLC for the machines and the enormous mess from all the slobs not putting the weights away they use nor does the terrible staff do anything about the mess. Every morning we get to the gym at 5AM, and more than 50% of all the free weights are scattered. It makes it impossible to enjoy working out. We get the usual excuse that the night staff is tired. So if they owned a fast food chain, it would be acceptable to just leave the customers' food and messes everywhere? Back to the germs and problems. Now let's get into how many cases of pink eye we have heard about and personally seen there - with all the sweat and people rubbing their face and eyes that have it and training on a machine you are waiting to use. Firstly, it will make you contract it. Secondly, you'll want to tell them to get out from the lack of respect and health concern for others they display.LA Fitness has displayed the longest delays on repairing simple seat and cushions on equipment that sometimes can take weeks for a simple re-cushioning. I have upholstery guys that redo car and house furniture, and it can be done within days. LA Fitness sucks. New members, beware!"
1054,644778,2013-01-08,2,"I have been a member with LA Fitness at the West Oaks Club for about 2 years. I chose this gym because it is on my way home from work. I did have a lifetime membership with Bally's Total Fitness in the Sharpstown area. I have noticed a great deal of changes in the staff for one. Once you get your membership then you go in with the rest of the cattle, no one helps or instructs you on the right way to use the equipment. The team changes over every 4 or 5 months, and this new team plays a great deal on their cell phones. Not that I need the help, but noticing that there are people who don't know much about the use of the equipment can cause injury to themselves. The real reason I have decided to write this complaint is because of the broken equipment. One machine has been broken for 6 months, and I have been asking when the machine would be fixed. One of the staff members said back in July that the guy comes on Mondays. I asked again, and the young guy at the desk told me that someone keeps throwing the notes away. The machine in question is the chest press. I really feel that a more responsible management team needs to replace the children that have been hired to do the job of professionals. Most of the time, I don't go this far to send a complaint; but I am a paying customer and don't feel that I should throw away my money and not say anything about my dissatisfaction with the gym I attend. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest without the machine being repaired."
1055,644466,2013-01-07,1,"Just signed up with LA Fitness and after one visit, I am really happy I didn't sign a contract. The gym has great eye appeal and the staff is really friendly, until you realize the reason they are being so. I went with a friend so we could motivate each other. They signed us up and then made an appointment for orientation. We showed up and the first 40 minutes are discussing your intent and checking your history health-wise. Goals are set and they go to great lengths telling you how they are going to meet those goals. They then took us through an extremely grueling routine, pushing all the way; saying if we were not sore afterwards, then they were not doing their job. That you need muscles to stretch to the point of tearing for weight loss to begin. As they take you through your workout, they will introduce you to a bunch of different trainers. Seemed very nice to have so much attention toward you. At the end of the session, back to the desk where you find out that in order to reach those goals, you need to hire a personal trainer. The price started at $45 per session and they recommend you do this 3 times a week. This goes on forever where they try to gauge the size of your wallet. Another 40 minutes later and at times, 4 trainers standing over you, the rock bottom price is $55 for 3 sessions = 3 routines. One trainer even had the nerve to say, ""Don't you at least have enough of a balance left on any of your credit cards?"" My girlfriend was so disgusted she just got up and left. So they all honed in on me. It was so uncomfortable and I got out of there with the promise to think about it. ""If you are serious, you know you need to do this. You have to decide within 72 hours or the prices go up."" I feel totally violated. Here I sit in so much pain I can barely move. I am not exaggerating. So I will go there until my 2 months I had to pay for in advance are used up, but I can guarantee you after that I won't go back. Through research, I have now found out that they work on strictly commission, but I have dealt with used car salesmen that have more class than they show. The eye appeal of this place is not worth it."
1056,642892,2012-12-30,1,"I was with my 15-year-old daughter (signed her up a month ago). I was showing her for the first time how to punch so she had boxing gloves on and I had Thai pads on before introducing her to the heavy bag. Izo (Training Manager) came to the heavy bag area and stated I could not train her and showed me a portion of a contract. I told him I couldn't have my daughter hit a heavy bag and she didn't know how to and he said I should take her to a boxing gym instead of working out here. He was very nasty. I asked, “So I should just let her hit the bag and possibly injure herself?” and he said, ""Well, she signed a waiver, didn't she?"" in a very nasty and unconcerned manner as though my child meant nothing. Then I asked for the general manager and he said over and over as he turned his back walking away, “Don't be training in here.” Very disrespectful. I felt bullied and as though my daughter and myself were treated as criminals. His entire attitude was disrespectful, demeaning and unacceptable, to talk to anyone like that, much less to a father in front of his child trying to spend quality time and how to protect herself from men seeking to do harm to her and a long term customer. He attempted to degrade me in front of my child and now my child is upset that she did something wrong and do not want to go to that gym. This is not the introduction into a lifelong commitment to working out with a gym I believe in, such as LA Fitness.I walked over to the General Manager’s desk and told him what happened and he said don't worry about it and it will never happen again and he was sorry. The general manager was very professional, courteous and sensitive to my child. I left the issue in his hands. However, later after the event, my daughter voiced her feelings of discomfort, embarrassment, hurtful senses and feeling bullied toward the incident and I'm feeling the same so I decided to contact corporate LA Fitness. I told them this: Please help me address the bully issue within your organization. I would hope you will not take this lightly so any other child, father or customer would not have to experience that insult. Thank you."
1057,642750,2012-12-29,1,"I recently changed fitness clubs after 13 years. I have joined the new LA Fitness in Newmarket, Canada for 6 months with my 3 teenagers because that's where they wanted to go. Beautiful new facility and friendly staff, but it seems poorly managed. On four occasions in the last 2 months, there were no soap and no paper towel in the washrooms. I complained twice, and both times, the club manager was not around or available. For the last 5 days, the hand sanitizers are empty. More of an annoyance than anything, but enough to leave and return to previous club that was cleaner."
1058,642314,2012-12-27,1,"LA Fitness was very interested in signing me and attempting to upsell me personal training. I joined foolishly. I attempted to get someone to show me how to use the weight machines. They said I needed to make an appointment, so I did, for the next evening at 6:30 pm. I showed up at 6:20 pm and warmed up on the treadmill. I showed up at the front desk promptly at 6:30. I was told that Cole was just finishing with his last appointment. I waited 12 minutes, which is seven more than my tolerance and 11 more than good customer service. I finally cancelled my appointment and the guy at the front desk said, ""Oh, okay,"" with no apology, no willingness to find Cole and no offer to reschedule. Apparently, this person has never been trained in the art of providing excellent service either. The next day, I called the Mill Creek, Washington club and left a message for the manager to call me. That was October. Today, it's 12/27/12, and to date, I've never gotten a call from anyone. Going forward, my charge card was hacked and cancelled, and now LA Fitness won't stop emailing me and calling me as they want my money. I was promised an email with the corporate URL so I could register a complaint; that never happened.I just spoke with Nick at 949-255-7200. He was very nice and he's waived my charges, but explained that LA Fitness does not do orientations on equipment. They only do a fitness orientation to assess fitness level so they can sell personal training. Duh, I joined a club only to wonder how to use the equipment safely? Needless to say, I'm through with LA Fitness. They have strong competition and there must be other clubs who are more customer-focused. Don't join LA Fitness. It's a big waste of money."

1060,641368,2012-12-21,2,"I have been a member of Bally's LA Fitness since 1994. I say that to show my loyalty. In regards to this Marina Del Rey Location, it needs help. The facility is old. The bathrooms are atrocious. At least the equipment was upgraded a few years ago. I also had a bad experience there today. I signed a friend up for a VIP pass. It's a complimentary 2-week pass that is not a guest pass or requires a $15 drop-in fee. The front desk person didn't understand so he brought in a manager. She said that we had to pay $15 guest pass fee. I said that this is not a guest pass (which is a 3-day non-fee pass anyways) and that it was a VIP pass. She then asked if my guest was a local resident. We said he wasn't but that shouldn't matter - it doesn't state anywhere that he has to be. Basically, she said my guest could work out today but that he couldn't get a VIP pass. She basically didn't care about supporting the current loyal member (me) by following the rules established by corporate and instead only cared that she wasn't going to be able to convert my guest to a paying customer membership. I didn't want to escalate the situation (although I did mention that there was no mention of local residency with either guest or VIP passes on the LA Fitness website where you claim them), so we just continued with our workout today. This is an opportunity for management there to improve their customer service and focus on customer loyalty."
1061,641317,2012-12-21,1,"My husband and I joined LA Fitness several months ago at the Highland Village, TX club. We were told by the sales manager that we would be receiving a discount that would lower our cost of a little under $60. At the time, we were already members of 24 Hour Fitness and paying about $10 less per month, but thought the facility was a little more up to our standards. Unfortunately, due to our schedules, we've only been able to visit the gym 2 times within the last 8 months. I was amazed at the 10+ calls we received within a 24-hour period when we missed a payment. I wish I had received that same enthusiasm from them after not showing up for several months. Nevertheless, it was at that time I noted I was not receiving an additional discount promised by the sales manager. I placed a call 2 times to the club, only to be placed on hold an average of 17 minutes each time while waiting to speak with the sales manager. I was told on my third call by Haley that I could come into the club and cancel my membership. The operation manager would be more than happy to do so. The sales manager was too busy to speak with me. I truly appreciate her candor and will be following up to do just that."

When I was signing up, I was told I can bring my 10-year-old to a class per instructor permission. Instructor was fine with bringing my daughter to a class, who loves yoga as I do. Yesterday I got called to the front desk by a manager and got yelled in front of other customers and stuff for bringing my child to a class. She told me I have to hire a baby sitter, in which I told manager why I would do that if I am paying for a Kids Club and wouldn't it be better to extend Kids Club hours while there are classes still running or make this class a little earlier. At that point, the manager went very angry and told me I have to find another club and canceled my membership. In any reason she also wanted to cancel my husband's membership, too, who has absolutely nothing to do with that story. I feel very humiliated and discouraged and don't want to go there anymore."
1063,639851,2012-12-14,1,"I was notified by LA Fitness that my renewal was due in July and that Bally's was purchased by LA. I told them I would come to the gym to Renee soon and they said okay. I was in the process of selling my house and was too busy to get down there. I did not worry about it since Bally's always let me renew late and just prorated the bill. Bally's would send me the bill in the mail and I would renew. Well I did not get a bill so I went to the gym to renew. They told me I was too late and they terminated my contract with Bally's, which I had been a member since 1990 and it was a lifetime membership. I talked to customer service and they would not budge. I was not told that I had only 90 days to renew or this would happen. If they wanted to change the way they handled renewals, they should have notified their consumers in writing of the changes they were making that we're different than Bally's. I would have gone up sooner to make the 90-day cut off if I had known. I paid thousands of dollars for this lifetime membership! Buyer beware when dealing with this organization. I told them I was going to report them to the Better Business Bureau and they laughed and said, ""Go ahead, everyone else does!"" I am going to pull my contract to see what other avenues I can take now."

I would receive in the mail a renewal offer from Bally's and I would pay with my credit card or send a check. It became LA Fitness and I wasn't notified in any form what the new membership details were. My membership was renewed with my old credit card information, without my permission at $250 for annual membership. I discovered this while trying to find out when my membership expired. I called to address this, and was told that I could cancel my membership at any time and the rest of the time would be prorated. I was told this to keep me as a member, which was partially a lie, because you are required to have a medical condition for this to occur. In attempting to cancel and get prorated refund, LA Fitness rep notified me that I physically signed renewal in writing in 2012 at Downtown LA location, which I haven't been to since 2009, that I couldn't receive prorated refund without medical condition. They attempted to guilting me to not continue with cancellation, just like when I first called and was promised I could get prorated refund at any time."
1065,637387,2012-12-03,1,"I have had a membership at this facility for over 3 years, joined shortly after it opened. This facility has continuously practiced little to no management in the maintenance of the facility. On any given day, there are multiple cardio machines inoperative. At times, this includes weight machines. Locker rooms have continued to degrade in cleanliness, as is the case of pool/spa area. Pool area ventilation system has failed numerable times, resulting in water damage to walls and ceiling and now closure for repair. I attempted to go to a brand new facility 6 miles away to find that its pool was also closed due to equipment failure. This leads me to believe that LA Fitness business practice is to ""cash-cow"" each facility, e.g. hire the low-bid contractor to build the facility and then spend as little as possible to maintain the facility, while aggressively marketing and signing new members to maximize cash flow from the facility before it becomes too dilapidated to attract new members. I am strongly considering going back to paying for the use of the local high school gym and pool."

Last Monday, they announced that from today (11/26), they are going to be closed for 2 months. So one week notice. My account charges every 14th of each month. I complained about this, since they just charged me for a full month and I was able to use it for 6 days! They told me I could go to another gym, but I explained to them that they are very far away. So they said that I could cancel my account! I said okay. So I canceled my account and you didn't give me back my 2 months (the month extra they made me pay when I joined and the current month they charged me). Then they said that I could freeze the account, but they charged me $10! So they close and I have to pay, plus they don't give me back my money! I'm so angry! I feel they are stealing from me! I called a number they gave me and explained the same thing. They also say they will only give me back one month or I can go and look for a lawyer! It's not about $10. It's about that it's not correct that they charged me when they are the one that decided to close the facility and not even bother to let me know before charging me."
1067,634463,2012-11-20,1,"I have been a customer of Bally since October 1992. I added my father, two sisters, and my two brothers to my account. I was laid off November 10, 2011, and was not able to renew my membership by my expiration date (April 28, 2012). I found part-time employment on June 21, 2012. After paying some of my bills, I called LA Fitness on November 19, 2012, to reinstate my membership. I was told that since I’m past the 90-day grace period, I will have to start over as a new member. I went back and forth about being a 20-year member that is being erased because I was not able to meet the 90-day grace period during this bad economy. I am very disappointed! Bally was more caring and forgiving. All one had to do was pay a reinstatement fee and resume your membership as past practice."
1068,633370,2012-11-15,1,"I felt like I was being interrogated when I went in to try their stupid gym. The manager claims the 2 weeks' VIP does not exist (each VIP you designate will enjoy a complimentary 2-week pass to work out at your club whenever they like; no guest pass or $15 guest fee necessary! Their name will be on your VIP list). This is what I got off their stupid website. I read it before I went in, so I'm not stupid. I hope no one joins this piece of crap gym."
1069,633369,2012-11-15,1,"I went in to LA fitness because my bf had just joined. He put me down under VIP, and of course, the manager at LA fitness called me asking me when I would come in. I told him that I would come in that day. Of course, when I got there, he was like “What can I help you with?” Dude, I have an appointment with you, and he's like “So what is it that you need?” Well, I just want to try out this gym for the 2 weeks that I have VIP. So, he gives me this tour and told me I can use the gym but he would need my license. Why would you need my license for? It's just an excuse for me to come back and talk to you. There was not enough machines, and the place just looks big, but all the machines they had there I could use the same machines at a cheaper place. Of course after I was done, I went back to get my license and talk to the guy. He was trying to get me to join. He was like “Oh, you know earlier when I told you about the $25 fee and $29.99 to join? We couldn't do that anymore. But if you join today, my boss said we can give it to you.” I told him I was only interested in trying it out for 2 weeks, and he was like “What 2 weeks?” I was like “The VIP thing said for two weeks.“ He was like “No, we don't do that.” **! If you don't do that, then what the ** is this crap? Each VIP you designate will enjoy a complimentary 2-week pass to work out at your club whenever they like. No guest pass or $15 guest fee necessary! Their name will be on your VIP list. I got this from your LA fitness website, so don't give me that **. I read all this stuff before I went in, and I don't like to be lied to. He was like “Why can't you join now?” Well, I'm not going to join now when I still have membership elsewhere. He was like “Who cares?” I care dude. That's money coming out of my pocket to pay you and pay the other gym. I guess he knew he was getting nowhere with me, so he was like “I'll send you a 1-week pass to try out the gym.” Forget your dumb pass. I will never ever go back to your gym ever. Of course the guy called me today, but I just hung up because I don't need him harassing me to join. I like to go to a gym where I can try it out, and if I don't want to join, I’m not harassed to join."
1070,630641,2012-11-06,1,"LA Fitness bought all the Illinois Bally’s locations. When my old Bally’s membership term ended, I took the bait of getting a free month with a prepaid annual membership. What a mistake! Within weeks, they closed both the facility near my office and the one near my home. I was not able to get a refund of my annual membership fee because there was still a club within 25 miles! When I questioned it, they told me to put it in writing and send it to California via registered mail since these things ""often get lost"". After multiple phone calls and emails, they told me the DOM (whoever that is) issued a final denial of refund. Bottom line is I'm out about $200 since the one club which is within a reasonable distance is so overbooked I can rarely get a spot in the pool."
1071,630497,2012-11-06,1,"We terminated our membership with Urban Fitness, now LA Fitness, at the end of September 2012. We not only paid the $10 per person document processing fee, we also signed the termination agreements. Now that LA Fitness has purchased the club, they continue to draw monthly dues and refuse to refund our money. They will not discontinue withdrawing from our account and state they cannot find any documentation. We have the copies of our checks and documents which they are insisting they must see in person. I would never recommend LA Fitness to anyone."
1072,630413,2012-11-06,2,"Urban Active was recently acquired by LA Fitness. I was told by Urban Active on Sept. 28, 2012, when I renewed my contract for 2 years, that I could not renew my guest privileges as the current rate of $100 for two years, as LA Fitness would have the final say. On Oct. 26, 2012, LA Fitness took over the facility. After some difficulty locating my membership renewal, I was told my guest privileges could not be renewed under the same conditions unless I could prove that my guest privileges were good for the past two years. I have a receipt that shows I paid $100 for paid in full guest privileges these past two years. But the contract does not note this, only the receipt! It does not take into account the extra free year for paying in full originally. LA Fitness said if I could confirm with Urban Active that I have used these guest privileges these past two years, that they would renew this part of the contract with the same cost of $100. As LA Fitness now owns this company, I am unable to obtain contact information for the prior office of Urban Active in order to obtain proof from their sign in sheets that I used these guest privileges this past year, and indeed it was a two year guest privilege. I cannot prove my case without records from the previous owners. Seems unfair."
1073,629801,2012-11-02,1,"When I joined 3 years ago, I also signed up for the personal training program. I received some of the program, but not all of it. When I said something to management about this, they said they would take care of it; but they never did. They're now asking me how they can better their service for the members. When I first joined, I was told that there would be trainers around the gym so that if I had any questions, I could ask them if they weren't busy helping someone else. Like I said before, when I enrolled in the training, I thought that I would get training for my self and not trainers playing with their cell phones and showing me if I was doing a specific exercise right or wrong. They're now asking me how they can better their operation. My biggest suggestion is to do what they are contracted to do. Because of their lack of concern for their members and following up with their side of the agreement, I am going to training with another company where I know I will get what I paid for."
1074,629419,2012-10-31,1,"The LA Fitness in New Hyde Park, NY is a poor excuse for an elite club. The club is dirty. There are not enough weights. The machines are broken and some are actually dangerous with people going on and falling off. There are not enough Purell dispensers. The paper towels are empty half the time. The bathrooms are disgusting. The lockers are falling off the hinges and aren't being replaced. TVs are missing. Parts of the ceiling are missing. The temperature is controlled by CA offices and it's always too hot, too muggy. The humidity in there is definitely a problem and makes it very difficult to breathe (and I don't have asthma or any type of breathing issues). I've made complaints to the BBB along with many other members. I was speaking to someone in member management and then suddenly his number stopped working, just like the machines in the gym stop working. They have a girl that comes in and is supposed to fix them, but all she does is hang out and nothing gets fixed. Something needs to be done."
1075,629382,2012-10-31,1,"As I walked out of the kid's club, the manager came up to me and told me my kids were banned from the kid's club. The manager said he tried to get in contact with me, but I did not receive a phone call with a voicemail or an email. The lady at the front told me that they tried to look for my information but couldn't. That doesn't make any sense, because one person is saying a different story than the other one! Also, the manager told me that my kids don't listen, which is the first time I heard about it. Poor managing skills and doesn't know how to talk to a customer in the right manner!"
1076,629309,2012-10-30,1,"LA Fitness is ripping members off by changing a regular location to a Signature status. When I signed up in Bellevue, WA location I was promised access to Kirkland, WA location as well, which at the time was being built. Then, for some reason LA Fitness decided to call Kirkland, WA location a Signature (the only difference between regular club and Signature is towels by front desk) and now they want to charge me additional $10/month to allow access to Kirkland. It is completely unfair and when explained to regional VP Larry **, his reply was, “We can do whatever we want, take it or leave it.”"
1077,628692,2012-10-27,2,"I am a member of LA Fitness because of their water aerobic classes. This is my second winter. I have rheumatoid arthritis and my doctor wants me to be in a low impact water class. The water is too cold for people with arthritis. I complained all last winter and it has been too cold for me this month and I expect it to be all winter. I, along with others, have requested the warm water be turned on at least a half hour before class but they have refused to do so. I need this class but the water is too cold. This is the only thing I do at LA Fitness. Can you help?"
1078,627449,2012-10-21,1,"I signed up for three months contract. They never told me I had to send a letter after the three months to cancel; otherwise, it was going to convert month to month agreement. I read the small print in the contract and sent my notification via mail last month. When I started the program, they didn't do the body measurements. I have to say the trainers were non-professional, always too busy to schedule me. By the 3rd month, I only completed 6 out of 12 sessions. Well, today is the 4th month and they still charged my bank account with $150 and said they didn't receive the letter of cancellation. It sounds like a scam to me. They want to give me four extra personal training in return when I have not completed the one recent. I wish people who are going through with this could sue them. I'm very stressed and disappointed. They are liars and thieves."
1079,627386,2012-10-21,1,"Recently LA Fitness, a large fitness chain out of Irvine California, purchased Lifestyles Family Fitness, a small fitness chain located in west central Florida. This has been nothing short of a nightmare for former members of Lifestyles. Lifestyles' clubs were like most other gyms, offering the latest in exercise equipment, clean buildings and friendly professional staff. The things that set Lifestyles apart from other fitness facilities were their Les Mills Group Fitness classes and their professional Personal Trainers. Lifestyles had a simple formula for its success; they paid their personal trainers well resulting in trainers who were some of the best in the business. Adversely LA's level of compensation for its trainers is pathetic. The net result is trainers who are incredibly not knowledgeable, inexperienced, and unprofessional. The old adage comes to mind, when you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. Personal training is quite expensive. Do LA members get lower priced PT contracts because of the poor quality of their trainers? It seems that the only thing LA is really concerned about is getting members pressured into signing incredibly expensive iron-clad contracts with no way out. Another important reason people were members of Lifestyles was because they offered Les Mills Group Fitness programs at all their facilities. When comparing Group Fitness, industry insiders consider Les Mills programs the benchmark in quality. Les Mills is a company whose commitment to excellence is unparalleled, music and techniques are always cutting edge, challenging yet safe. Les Mills programs are fun, motivating and most importantly, get results! This quality does not happen without a price; however, Les Mills charges a pretty hefty fee in order for a fitness company to offer its programs. Companies who choose to pay the premium in order to offer Les Mills programs demonstrate a real commitment to provide quality training options for their members. It's apparent that LA doesn't give a hoot about its members; the company has money coming out of its ears yet choose to offer their own goofy versions of step, kick boxing, spinning, floor aerobics, yoga, etc. LA's home grown fitness programs are incredibly weak, do not motivate, and are a complete bore. Comparing Les Mills Body Step class to LA's Step and Abs class is like comparing dining at one of those fancy Brazilian steak houses to eating a cheese sandwich at home by yourself! LA Fitness is the largest fitness company in the US. Their buildings are some of the most beautiful facilities around. Fitness nuts along with everyday Joes would love to workout in these beautiful buildings but sadly the quality isn't inside. LA is the epitome of the phrase all show and no go. If you are considering joining LA Fitness, I encourage you to please do your homework. Try Googling complaints about LA Fitness - you will be surprised at what you see. If you have already joined, I don't recommend googling anything about LA. What you see will likely ruin your day. There are plenty of other options out there; please don't support a business that doesn't care about the quality of products and services they offer, or for the people who pay for them. Buyers beware."
1080,627087,2012-10-19,1,"My wife and I went to LA Fitness in Irving location (5550 N. MacArthur Blvd. IRVING, TX 75038) to join as well as to discuss personal training programs. Personal training director named ** talked about different programs for almost two hours. He misled us in many ways. There was a big board in front of this location about $0 enrollment. But when we asked about that, he said it's nothing and it's only to bring the crowd inside. He only mentioned 52 and 28-week sessions for personal training. Until we asked about any prepaid sessions, he didn't give it. At last, he gave the prepaid sessions and there is one program for 12 sessions for $480. It's clearly mentioned that we can use it anytime and own it. When we asked him about that, he immediately told that they just printed it. It doesn't mean anything and we should use them within 30 days. We realized that we have been misled and so we politely said that we want to work with somebody else. He immediately became so rude and asked us to get out and join 24 Hour Fitness. He was very unprofessional."
1081,625846,2012-10-14,1,"I had the highest access membership with Bally's - full access to all clubs, tennis, pool, racquetball, all free at all clubs. When LA Fitness took over our Bally's club, we were told that we needed to transfer our membership to an LA Fitness membership (sounds good so far). Then, when a new LA Fitness club opened up in Kirkland, WA, we decided to try it. As it turns out, this is a ""signature"" club (a fancy way to make all amenities ‘a la carte’), and we cannot visit it without being charged an additional fee. This appears to be a classic bait-and-switch type of behavior, which seems to be typical of health clubs in general. LA Fitness takes this to a new level of dishonesty. When I notified the manager (Matt) at the Kirkland club, he was very impolite and was unwilling even to listen to my concerns without continually interrupting and dismissing me - impolite, certainly, and likely part of the LA Fitness culture of focusing on sales, not service. As a result of this, we are unable to use the LA Fitness club closest to us and must travel quite a distance to access a non-signature club. I wonder how long it will be before LA Fitness upgrades (e.g., makes towels available to members) all of its clubs to ""signature"" status. This will allow them to change the game in midstream and make the transferred memberships valueless. Consumers can do nothing about it but complain unless a class action suit is in the making, and I will certainly join it. Don't buy any memberships at LA Fitness without considering the consequences."
1082,625159,2012-10-11,1,"I signed up for LA Fitness because I was told it was an easy cancel if it didn't work out. I explained at start up that I barely work and was in the process of finding a job. Their persistent attempts at ""selling"" services were annoying and I finally gave in because I wanted to improve my health. After trying out a personal training session, along with classes and equipment, I decided I did not fit in at this gym. It was too $ monthly, I still have not found a full-time job. I had a death of an uncle in the family, and I've been getting check-ups and procedures done due to cysts. I attempted to cancel my personal training in August, but no club member ever got back to me. Anytime they called me, it was for more selling. I then got frustrated and sent a letter. Once again, no cancellation went through & nobody contacted me for help. So I wrote another letter, this time sending both to my local gym and the main office in CA. I received a letter confirming my cancellation; however, I continue to see $160 being taken out of my account that I do not authorize for personal training I do not receive. I have tried talking to customer service over and over. They say they'll call me back and never do. They say I'm on a contract, but Tim from Springfield, MA said I was not on a contract, which is why I paid over $200 just for a start-up fee. I am beyond frustrated and even broke down in tears on the phone. I don't have time due to medical appointments and job hunting nor money to pay such a selfish and horrible customer service company."
1083,625018,2012-10-10,1,"LA Fitness takes greed and slime to a whole new low level. The Bally closed, and they switched us all to LA Fitness on 1st Avenue in Tucson. They first told me I had no Bally membership. Then they told me it was cancelled. Then they found it. The place is filthy. The sauna is tiny, and barely above body temperature, in fact there are live crickets under the slats of the seats. It holds maybe 5 people. There are never paper towels in the locker room. The hot tub is usually out of order, and when not, a stew of hair and filth is stirred up in the center of the water due to poor design of the jets. There are far too many people in the place; you can never complete your workout routine as a result. The employees are pompous, rude, and pretentious; however, they get paid next to nothing, so I can't blame them. It was impossible to request a refund (I had prepaid a year at Bally) and cancel my unwanted LA Fitness membership. So I filed a complaint with my credit card, and they refunded the money I had paid to Bally. Good riddance to a hellhole of a place. It's the worst of my life, and gyms are notorious, as it is. The two owners of LA Fitness, both billionaires, scoop into a town, force most other gyms out of business, and their greed is palpable. Forewarning you people, if you want to join up with such a place. Sad commentary on what's become of the corporate climate in this country."

So for the past few months, I've been in the yoga room at LA Fitness doing the workouts on my own with the door closed. Today, I was asked to leave because it’s not allowed and doing Insanity at the gym takes money away from the Instructors. Wow, what's the difference between a laptop that disturbs no one and a set of earphones playing motivational music? I wasn't annoying anyone. I was completely alone in a room that was not being used. Pathetic. LA Fitness, you guys are money hungry people."
1085,620894,2012-10-01,1,"I’m with LA Fitness buying out the contracts of Bally's. I was told that my contracts with Bally's would be honored. To my dismay, that is not the case. Since I had renewed my contract for 2 years, LA Fitness is only going to renew my contract if I pay what I paid last time for a year. In other words, since I paid $265.00 for two years, I now have to pay $265.00 per year if I want to continue. When I pointed out that $265 for two years translates to $137.50 per year, they seem to not get it. It leaves me thinking if a manager cannot do the basic math of what $265 for two years means per year, what does that say about LA Fitness: incompetent or unscrupulous? You tell me! I think both."

This is the first time I have ever heard of sending a cancellation form via mail or even filling one out, period! So why even cancel with them? Well, I have a health condition that makes it hard to work out as much as I used to and I am getting sick of seeing a withdrawal of $10 being taken out of my account every two weeks by LA Fitness. So now, on top of medical bills and the rest of my bills, I also have a stupid withdraw of $20 per month that is going to nothing! I guess LA Fitness doesn't want you to rejoin! LA Fitness equals waste of money."
1087,612469,2012-09-03,1,"I have a training package from LA Fitness purchased at the beginning of 2012. In August of 2012, I was told my current trainer had been promoted to master trainer and there would be a small fee increase if I chose to continue with him. I asked for a copy of the requirements to be a Master Trainer and was given the following information from an internal LA Fitness email dated August 10, 2012: “What is a Master Trainer? He/she is a seasoned trainer who has demonstrated exceptional motivational skills and aptitude for combing progressive training with the ability to address the needs of a diverse clientele. This person has proven their ability to handle a high amount of clients, conduct themselves in a professional manner and is a career minded employee with Pro-Results. Before being classified as a Master Trainer, an individual must express the desire to be classified as such and be approved for promotion to Master Trainer status by both his District/Regional VP and Jon **. The ultimate test is whether a trainer is confident that 80% or more of his/her clients would feel comfortable paying $10 to $15 more per session to continue to train with him or her.” As this internal LA Fitness email states, there is no further training required to charge more money, just the confidence the client will pay it."
1088,609545,2012-08-25,2,"In early July 2012, under Trainer Director Shaun **, I signed up for personal training sessions. Shaun explained to me that I was in luck - they could offer me a great discount of personal training classes and that he understood exactly what I needed. He signed me up for a 10 sessions at $224.00 a month. Regular pricing would have been over $400 a month. He too said that he had the perfect personal trainer for me as Alex and explained to me that Alex was a master trainer and I would be working with their best. Strangely, about a few weeks later in July, I get another call from LA Fitness. Apparently, Marlon, Director Counselor, called me and said he needed for me to come in and sign something. Needless to say, I was confused by his request since I had already signed something. When I got there, they quickly told me there was a change in price but that my monthly charge would actually decrease by about another $14 a month. In other words, I needed to sign a new contract to get the lower discounted rate. He quickly pulled out a contract and I signed it. But when I asked him to point out in the contract where it actually shows the rate as being lower than what I was currently paying, he could not seem to find it and looked a bit lost. He said, ""Oh, maybe I did not print the right one."" I then ripped it up and said, ""Okay, when you find the right one, call me back so that I can re-sign under the lower rate.""August 2012 - by this time, I had about four sessions with Alex and he pretty much told me that he was now a master trainer and that his rate was increasing. I would only need to pay an extra $5 per session (which equates to an extra $50 per month). I politely told Alex I would talk to Shane. Obviously, I was confused about his story because when I initially signed up under Shaun, I was told that Alex was a master trainer and that I would be working with the best.After speaking with Shane **, he pretty much said the same thing Alex had said. He explained that Alex was now a master trainer and that I would have to pay an extra $50 a month to stay with Alex. Shane also said that for my banked sessions, I would have to pay the difference. Bank sessions? What was that? Shane explained that I too would then have to pay for the past four sessions an extra $5 per session or another $20 for the past sessions.Needless to say, I was infuriated with this request. I saw it nothing more than a bait and switch tactic and told him so. Shane feigned ignorance and said he didn't even understand what that meant. Really, Shane? Read this: Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are ""baited"" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are ""switched"" to a costlier product.LA fitness sells me on a lower discounted training session package of 10 (30 minute) sessions per month at $224.00 (regular price would have been around $400). And now, he tells me that if I wish to stay with my trainer, I would have to pay an extra $50 per month which would come to about $275 a month. I see LA Fitness and management as nothing more than street hustlers, bullying the customer."
1089,609320,2012-08-24,1,"I joined LA Fitness Bolingbrook, Illinois on July 30, 2012, and I have never, in my 44 years of living, experienced such treatment as I did with one of their fitness trainers by the name of Shane (I don't have his last name). After completing the enrollment process, I was recommended to take a one-on-one personal training session. After the completion of that session with Shane, he had me sit at his desk where he proceeded to inform me of my need to purchase some additional sessions on an ongoing basis. I informed him that I was not in the market for that at this present time, and perhaps in the future, after speaking with my husband who is also a member at this location. After I declined, Shane's whole demeanor changed. He began to ask several insulting questions such as, ""does your husband make all of the decisions for you, don't you have your own finances and you can't make your own decisions,"" in a very condescending voice and attitude. I thought he was going to say, ""I'm joking"" or ""I'm playing,"" but he continued with several more insulting statements such as, ""it's very obvious that you need to work out because you are completely out of shape."" Again, I informed him that I was not in the market for personal training now, perhaps in the future. He then got out of his seat threw his pen down hard, and said, ""You're obviously not serious about your health or your well-being so you can get out now!"" in a very threatening tone. I was very taken aback by the whole experience and said, ""Are you seriously talking to me like that and being that rude?"" He responded by saying, ""You heard me. Bye, leave."" My 6-year old daughter was beside me and witnessed the whole thing. I felt threatened and harassed and I was also very embarrassed for my daughter to have witnessed all of this. I grabbed my daughter and left. I notified my husband of the situation when I got home and he said several of his workout friends (who are also members of Bolingbrook LA Fitness) had already called him and informed him what they had witnessed, not aware that I was his wife.I am still interested in this facility because of the location. However, I don't want to be associated with any company if this is a common practice and/or this is swept under the rug, as a one-time experience because I do understand that it's not from other members. I also don't want to feel harassed, degraded or insulted when I come to this facility nor should any other female or member.I spoke with Pat, the office manager, and he offered me 2 guest passes. I informed him that I wasn't interested in the 2 passes and after 5 minutes of going back and forth with him, I had to ask him for an apology. I felt that the purpose of the returned call was to defend the associate. He was very unsympathetic and insensitive to my experience. I asked him for the owner's name or his boss' name and he would not relinquish any of that information, and said that he represents corporate."
1090,608976,2012-08-22,1,"I went in signing up for a month to month membership, because I am only in Minnesota for roughly three months. They knew I was returning to Montana where LA Fitness doesn't exist, but trainer Andre ** tricked me into signing a year contract. I am a disabled person/stroke survivor. Andre used that to his advantage getting me to sign a year contract. Knowing I wouldn’t be here a year, I only got one session out of the four I was promised. After talking to many people on the phone, they called me a liar and Alicia called my husband a **. What kind of professionalism is this? So, we decided to stand out in front of their business locations, hand out fliers to what they do to disabled people. The trainer is too much in love with himself to give any type of training to help anyone. He actually tried to have me talk dirty to him - he’s a disgusting ex-wannabe pro basketball player, who didn't make it and holds that bitterness against others in the gym. No one cares about the scam, so I am figuring this is how they do business! No honesty here! Save your money and time. No one cares to help you out either!"
1091,608132,2012-08-18,1,"After signing up for the initial membership, I came back at a later time for a sample of a personal training session. After the sample, I decided to sign up for one month to see whether a personal trainer would work for me. When I signed up, I was told the initial fee was $149 and $200 for four sessions for that one month. I specifically told the person who signed me up that I wanted to try it for one month. At no time was I told I would be signing an agreement to bill my account monthly for trainer session fees. When they have you sign the electronic paperwork, you are under the impression you're signing the authorization to have them debit your account for the initial fee and one month of training sessions - in my case, I thought I was agreeing to a total, onetime cost of $349. Again, at no time did the representative indicate I would be billed a monthly charge. Also, the electronic screen they have you sign is very small and it only shows a signature line. This means you have to ask the rep signing you up for services what it is you are signing for. There is nothing on the little screen they have you sign that tells you it is a finance agreement (I never would have signed this). Also, the electronic copy of the Agreement itself does not even tell you that it is a finance agreement. Instead, the title states Personal Training Agreement and Release of Liability, and it is not until you look through it that you see it is a finance agreement. Again, you don't know you've signed a finance agreement until it is emailed to you. To add insult to injury, even though there's a note of a 10-day cancellation in the PDF sent to you (if you can find it in the small print), what good does this do you when you don't even realize you are signing a finance agreement in the first place?Last, if you want to get out of the Agreement, you have to pay 50% of the value of the Agreement. So, a minimum of over $1,000 to get out of the agreement, and what do you get in return? Do you at least get the value of the remainder of the training sessions? One would think they could at least give you that. It's possible you may later find the sessions to be of value to you, and you might choose to continue them. However, as this system is currently rigged, you're upset at what one might consider to be deceptive practices, and unlikely to see it as a positive experience. In today's world, one can go almost anywhere to acquire services. As is the case for conveniences, gym membership for most may not be a necessity, but rather a convenience for which one may be willing to pay. Folks will pay this fee if the gym is convenient to get to, and if they have good feelings about the facility.When so many people have the opportunity to share their experiences, it seems to me, if you are a business, even if you sign one or 10 people up using these practices, would you not be concerned at the 10, 20, or 100 potential customers lost? It seems to me that in today's world, customer service should be a strong ""leg"" of every business model. I, like most people, read online reviews to help me make decisions about how and where to spend my time and dollars. I am sad that I did not see these reviews prior to my experience, and even sadder to have to add my voice to the growing cacophony of unfavorable reviews. I will follow up with results of a resolution (if and) when obtained."
1092,606478,2012-08-14,1,"My fiance and I are thoroughly disgusted with the business practices at LA Fitness. We signed up for a membership and scheduled a much touted personal training session. I was excited to go. The first part of the ""personal training session"" consisted of questions regarding my previous workout routines and current goals. The second part consisted of a 15 minute workout of squatting and tossing the medicine ball. The last part was used-car salesman sales techniques (writing #'s down on paper, crossing them out, and writing different numbers down) to get me to sign up for a personal training contract. ""About 90% of our members sign up for this!"" Really? I doubt it. It costs another ""initial fee"" of $149 plus sessions of at least $35 each. This is, of course, in addition to the ""regular"" membership initiation fee and monthly fees. At no time did the trainer create a workout routine for me, which is precisely what I believed I was there to get. Last night, my fiance and I went to work out for the first time and we hated it. The equipment was old, the carpet a mess, and it had that ""meat market"" feeling. We told the front desk person it wasn't for us and would like our money back. She referred us to the guy who sold us the membership who referred us to a customer service number. Since it was more than three days (it was a week) since we'd signed our contract, it was ""out of his hands."" My fiance spoke with the customer service office today, and what he got was an arrogant, uncaring response. ""The letter of the law says"" we gave them $350, and they will not give us one dime back. Despite that, we are cancelling our membership. We don't want to be associated, in any way, with a company that does business like this. I'm truly surprised they're still in business. Despicable."
1093,606323,2012-08-13,2,"LA Fitness is now allowing cleaning women in the Men's locker rooms during normal business hours. Nothing like being surprised, as you turn away from the urinal naked. The men's locker room is a ""non-coed"" open area to the showers, sauna, urinals, toilets and of course, the lockers and benches. This is an area where members dress, undress, and walk around without any clothing but carrying a towel, in most cases. LA Fitness management supports this policy. It is embarrassing enough having to deal with the gay behavior in the men's locker room. They could at least send in a hottie cleaning lady."
1094,606174,2012-08-13,2,"I came in to get a membership at the Universal City location. I received a complimentary personal training session. After the session, I was asked if I wanted to get a personal trainer. I signed up for a personal trainer but was only able to make half of the down payment, but they took my bank account information to take out the rest. 2 weeks later, I called into advise that I would be unable to continue keep the personal trainer since I had found out I had a pretty bad kidney condition and the doctor advised that I would be unable to workout for a couple of months. The rep advised that he would make sure my account wasn't charged and would put the reasons in the system as to why I was cancelling. I asked if a doctor's note was needed as proof and he advised that it wasn't needed and that my account will no longer be charged. But while I was in the hospital recovering from surgery, my account got charged a little over $1,000 for services I never used. Now when I inquired about restarting my gym membership, they are saying that the sessions were never cancelled and that I still owe that money even though I never received one session. I just need to get this resolved and would like to get my gym membership back on track."
1095,603392,2012-07-29,2,"I have been a loyal member of LA Fitness for over 6 years now and I would like to let you know how dissatisfied I am with your local business practices. Since I have been a member of the club, the problems in the gym keep growing: (1) problem of robbery at the parking lot and inside the men's locker, (2) the carpet at the men's lockers smell like a death dog, (3) the Jacuzzi needs to be resurfaced and (4) we run out of paper and body wash often and the water fountains has only warm water. For many years, I have not been happy with LA Fitness management. Every time I make observations, nothing is down. ** and ** do not have knowledge of customer service. In particular, ** is the worst person to talk about anything, bad person. I am disgusted with the lack of professionalism when it comes to how issues are dealt with by current management. My recommendation is to replace GM ** and ** from the Chula Vista, East Lake Branch. Many other members who complain and I were made to think our common concerns were going to be investigated and we would be updated. The lack of professionalism and seriousness from your business is astounding."
1096,603344,2012-07-28,2,"I find it disheartening that when a machine or piece of equipment breaks down, weeks, if not months, go by before it is fixed. I find myself going to other LA Fitness facilities, which are completely out of the way, in order to maximize my work out routines. I think it is unfair that LA Fitness automatically withdraws my gym fees from my bank account, without fail, but yet, it cannot keep its end of the bargain by keeping the facility in working order. I seriously doubt my written complaint will result in any of the aforementioned being corrected; however, I thought I'd let my feelings be known. For the record, I am referencing the LA Fitness in Doral in South Florida."
1097,603197,2012-07-27,1,"I had joined Bally's in 2011. Bally's was then bought out by LA Fitness. I was in the process of canceling my account with Bally's when they shut down the facility. The building was now vacant. I thought that my account was closed. I was just going to Bally's to get a confirmation letter. The next month (January 2012), I got a bill from LA Fitness. I called the nearest gym and spoke to an operations manager, who assured me it was just a billing error and he would close my account and credit me. It never happened. I continued to be billed bi-weekly. I contacted several different branches and got the same response. All promised to resolve my issue, yet none did. I asked for the corporate phone number; the number was for recruitment. I contacted my bank, which had stated that I had used an e-signature, so I would have to resolve it with the company. Today, 7/27, I was finally able to get a corporate number that did work. I spoke to a representative named ""Paul,"" who flat out called me a liar even though I had names, dates, and what club each person worked at that I had spoken to and on top of that my cell phone records. After I informed Paul of this, he said he would connect me to his manager. I was then on hold and ultimately re-routed to a new representative, who was not a manager. I had to explain my frustration yet again. This new representative Jenna would not allow me to explain the situation but rather preferred to cut me off mid-sentence. After 15 minutes of going back and forth, Jenna agreed to refund 4 months of charges, but not one month more. I had moved to Northern California in January and was 7 months pregnant. I was a good 10 hours from a club, yet she claimed that there was activity. Impossible! I asked for proof, and she said that until I contact them directly, I would continue to be billed. For the last 6 months, I have been trying to do this! I was sent an email confirmation that stated that my membership had been cancelled and that I would be billed again for the next 30 days (That is not what she had told me at all; she stated all billing was to end right then.) and if I need to cancel my membership, to contact my local gym!"
1098,603181,2012-07-27,1,"My personal training contract has a billing date of the 5th of each month. For three months in a row, they withdrew funds from my account on the 26th. I complained to the Corporate Office. They referred me to the ""Customer Service Manager"" at the Pico Rivera location where I signed the contract. She was a waste of time. I was credited the first month because they billed me for two months. The next month, they billed me on the 26th and overdrew my account. I asked to suspend the contract for two months because I was moving and they billed me anyway, overdrawing my account again. They credited me back the money less $45 for the suspension fee. The two months are up and on the 26th, I was hit with another withdrawal. I have tried working with them and all they say is that they are not in breach of contract and all they are obligated to do is try to fix the problem next time. There is only one more month of these withdrawals and all they say is ""Sorry, better luck next time."" I have notified my bank to stop all transactions from them. I should also say that they are billing me $240 each month. This is the worst business practice I have ever seen. Do not sign the personal training contract. The first few sessions are a waste of time. You will get better results hiring your own trainer."
1099,603006,2012-07-27,1,"The worst LA Fitness staff is in the Johns Creek, GA location. I asked the front desk woman to turn the music down as it was so loud I was getting a headache. The speakers are directly above the treadmills. Forget about using your iPod, the music there is so loud you can barely tolerate it. Worst, the woman at the front desk had the audacity to yell at me for asking her to turn it down. I could not believe how incredibly rude and unprofessional the staff at this location is. Do not join this location. I am deeply offended and disgusted by how the front desk woman addressed my concern."
1100,602292,2012-07-24,1,"I am complaining about the way LA Fitness Personal Trainers Program scams unsuspecting members like me into signing up for one of their Personal Trainers Programs. I wanted to cancel the agreement/contract before I would get started but was informed by the general manager of that LA Fitness location that it was too late to cancel and that there was nothing they could do to help me. I had informed them I was not working full time and wouldn't be making enough of an income to afford the session. I wish the original staff who had attended me would have informed me verbally at the time what the timeline was and about any other information needed to cancel the agreement. Now they have charged me a total of $149 initiation fee plus 1st month’s session of $70. All I wanted was to get the Personal Trainer Program cancelled and a refund of the $219 they charged me. I am out of the $219 which I couldn't afford. I only work like 2 to 3 days a week and make minimum wage of $48 an hour. I really feel the PT staff who had attended me that day singled me out and somehow swindled me into getting into one of their personal trainers sessions. I've always had a good relationship with LA fitness even when they had bought out Bally's Fitness which I was originally with when they took over. Because of this deception on their part, they have put me in dire financial difficulties"
1101,602271,2012-07-24,2,"I visited this location (L.A. Fitness, Old Nat'l Highway, College Park, GA) for the first time on Wednesday, July 18th. I met with **, a guy in the operations department, for about an hour to discuss membership options, sign paperwork and tour the facility. He is currently a salesperson at this location. I let him know that I would be traveling over the next two weeks but would like to access the gym on a trial basis. He pointed out that I had a trial membership in February but that will not pose an issue since I'm signing up for membership. He assured me that I could visit this facility on a trial basis until my membership kicks in on August 2nd. He said that was fine and assured me that I would not have an issue when visiting the gym in the interim. So, since that conversation, I've visited that gym twice since signing the contract (due to my travel schedule last week) and was looking forward to visiting again to get a full workout tonight, July 23. Well, this was not the case tonight. ** was working the front desk and informed me that my key was not activated. I explained that I know it isn't but ** stated that I could visit without any issues. He said, ""Well, you are not in the system and I can't let you in."" He said he was only doing his job. However, the funny thing is he was there when I signed the contract but I'm sure he sees so many people that it's hard to recognize everyone at a later date.So, I am extremely disappointed that I was promised something that was not true. Workout for me is a lifetime commitment. I even cancelled my membership at my old gym of over 7 years because, again, I was told I could access this gym without any issues until my membership kicks in. The salesperson was very adamant that everything would be fine. My contract was written up and I gave him my credit card information to process everything. ** stated that nothing is noted on my account. I do not want to join a gym that does not uphold their end of the bargain. I feel it was a ploy to get me to sign the contract. At this point, I am looking forward to terminating the contract altogether and plan to join my old gym again. At least, there, I know they will uphold the established agreement."
1102,601760,2012-07-20,1,"I am having a problem with LA Fitness in the North Hills, Pittsburgh, PA. Back in August 2011, I wanted to check out the gym. I was told if I join, I have a certain amount of time to cancel my membership. I also spoke with a personal trainer. I ended up cancelling my membership but was never told personally that I could not cancel the personal trainer. When I cancelled the gym membership, I thought all was taken care of. I recently had to go to the bank and realized that in August 2011, they took out $598.00 for membership fees. When I cancelled, they only reimbursed me $49.00. Also, since that time, they have been taking $120.00 a month from my bank account. I never was even given an actual tour of the facility and never been in to work out. I never even had a tour! All told, they took $1,980.00 from my account and I have received no services or have been in the gym to work out. When I was in the bank trying to get this all figured out, the gentleman told me that there was another man in the bank right before me complaining of the same thing. I would like them to be investigated, because I feel that this is a fraudulent practice. I know there are other people out there who need to be aware of their practices. I live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be paying someone $2,000 for no reason. I have filed a complaint with the attorney-general and the BBB, and I have filed a civil suit. They are terrible to deal with. I will tell everyone I know not to join. They do not deserve to be in business."
1103,601741,2012-07-20,1,"I had been a member with Bally's for nearly 10 years before it was bought out by LA Fitness. Since I did not attend the gym regularly, I found out through a friend that this business transaction took place. I did not receive an official letter from LA Fitness until several months later. I thought the letter would include a new contract for me to sign if I wanted to continue my membership - it did not. Apparently, LA Fitness took over Bally's memberships without any consent from the customer. I was annoyed by this but figured the details of my membership would remain the same. I was wrong. Under my Bally's agreement I could attend any Bally's gym. With LA Fitness, I was limited to only going to the gym that I signed up at. Also, my monthly dues went up from $16 with Bally's to $21 with LA Fitness. Due to my busy schedule, I never attended the LA Fitness gym; and based on how I've seen how they construct business, I wasn't very impressed. So I decided to cancel my membership. I had to call the branch where I signed up at, and they told me that I had to come in and fill out paperwork to cancel. I recently moved and told them that I no longer live near that gym and it was not convenient for me to drive out there just to cancel the membership. I explained that I did not ask to be an LA Fitness member and I never signed any contract agreeing to any of LA Fitness' terms or conditions. I also told them that I believed they were making this difficult for me to cancel my membership, so that I would keep paying the fees. In this day and age, it is not difficult to cancel memberships over the phone or via emails - there are several security questions in place that can make it legit. Not only that, I find it ridiculous that I have to drive over an hour to just cancel a membership with LA Fitness that I have never used. I am waiting to hear back from the manager on Monday. The facts that I never signed any contract with LA Fitness, I wasn't notified until several months later of the takeover, the fees went up, I was now limited to one gym, and I can't even cancel my membership in an easy manner mean bad business and an exploitation of their customers."
1104,601602,2012-07-19,1,"Compassionate actions by El Norte general manager - On Thursday afternoon, July 19, I went to the gym location I normally use and asked for a 3-day pass for my son visiting from Colorado. First of all, the desk crew spent 10 minutes tracking down someone to assist. The general manager came over and I tried to explain my situation that he was visiting and I wanted to get him a 3-day pass. Of course, money immediately comes to the forefront - not what's the reason, why would you need only three days - just cost. I again explained he was just visiting and I must assume that because he lives in Colorado, he's not a perspective member and just doesn't count. I didn't explain my personal situation and asked for a cancellation form, which he gave me and couldn't have cared whether I cancelled or not. I took the form and walked out. My son went back in to explain that my wife, who is on her death bed after fighting cancer for a year, that I have been her primary caregiver during that time. His comment, ""We are not a charity."" It was explained that no one was asking for charity, just a bit of compassion. It's not an everyday occurrence that someone gets overstressed and needs to be allowed to release a terrible amount of tension and emotion at your facility. The kid could have cared if any of us cancelled. If this is your business practices, I do want to cancel. I am not a vindictive or malicious person, but in the case of your representative, I am going to talk to friends and family and try to spread the word about the most unprofessional staff members I have ever dealt with. It is also my intention to talk to my friends and family members in fire and law enforcement to withdraw from you organization. I will be a widower in less than 30 hours and I will certainly dedicate my pent up anger and passion of losing my mate of nearly 50 years to hurting La Fitness' business. Your company is a service-oriented organization, but it seems that you forget that. If you think you want to sue me, please be my guest."

1106,600424,2012-07-13,1,"I am writing to report a serious issue with your Van Nuys location. I was at the gym today. There had been a sign outside the women's locker room for about 40 minutes that there were gentlemen inside and they were doing some maintenance. I went in and looked around and there was no one in there. So I came out and asked the man (Eric) at the reception if they were done as there was no one inside. His reply was they were probably done. I took down the sign and told him that I was going to take a shower and Eric said he was going to keep an eye out. All the women staff was at the break at this very time, so Eric said he was just covering for them. I went in there and was about to take a shower when a man walked in. I tried calling into the Van Nuys location later to speak to a manager. I wasn't able to get her, but the lady I spoke to just argued on about it to no end and took no responsibility."

There's no cleaning crew in the day time, leaving equipment full of people's sweat and everything. And members lifting weights slam the equipment like they have never been to a gym, and employees do not even care even though a lot of the machines get out of service because of these idiots. Whatever happened to company pride? Get some people who care about what they do and take care of it like it was their own. And by all means, hire a cleaning crew."
1108,599042,2012-07-10,1,"I signed up for a membership and personal training package in May when I worked in the area. Then, I started having health issues that prevented me from working out and I quit my job in the area. I canceled my gym membership which was fine, but then they refused to cancel my year-long personal training package because I canceled it 12 days after the trial period ran out, even though I gave a doctor's note from a certified MD and the manager told me he'd handle it. Instead, he said he'd be in the gym, but was out of the gym on a 3-hour lunch break. So, I was forced to deal with a rude woman who wouldn't deal with my problem as she sat at her computer with a soda and said she had ""15 minutes left of her lunch break."" I asked if I could please speak to someone else, but they said none of the other people at the gym could handle my problem. The other manager cut her lunch break short (briefly) to tell me that my doctor's note wasn't good enough and everything the training manager had told me the prior day about the MD note and freezing the account was false and I was forced into paying $1400 in a buy-out to avoid what would have been double that $2000 in damages if I didn't. I realize I signed the year-long contract, but no one ever told me verbally that I wouldn't be able to get out of it. It's confusing because the gym membership is month-to-month. If you're no longer a member, I don't understand how you can be expected to incur $312 fees per month in personal training costs."
1109,597052,2012-06-29,1,"The ""Signature"" club in Secaucus is a complete joke. The staff there is by far the rudest people I have ever been around. They give you dirty looks for no reason, don't do their jobs since they are always just sitting around talking to each other, and forget about them actually fixing broken equipment. Second, the place is also the biggest dump of a gym based on cleanliness I have ever been in, and I have been in a ton of gyms. If you work out there in the evening (anytime from 5 pm till about 10 pm), the weight room looks like a tornado just went through it. Nobody who works out there puts stuff away when they are done. Nobody! The locker room always has sinks that don't work, empty soap dispensers, and trash/dirty towels everywhere. If every other gym in the Hoboken/Weehawken area isn't so damn expensive, there is no way I would stay at this gym. The only reason I stay here is because of the price actually being cheaper as to what is around me as alternatives."
1110,596259,2012-06-28,2,"Employees and Executives lacking Customer Service Skills! - I've reported a number of concerns I've had to LA Fitness Corporate Headquarters and each time, they ignored me or called me a liar. Then yesterday, I attended a Latin Heat Class at 9 pm. Before attending the class, I handed off a class registration ticket to an LA Fitness Staff. As I passed it to the staff member, it slipped out of my hands and fell. LA staff member screamed the following at me, ""You need to get back here and pick this up and hand it to me,"" in front of other class members. I went to pick it up and headed into the room so I could put my things down (water bottle, keys, phone, book) etc. so that I could hand it to her properly this time. She proceeded to yell, ""Don't think you can go into that class without giving me the pass."" As I headed back to her to hand the pass, she screamed again, ""I don't understand why this has to be so ** difficult."" I handed her the pass again and said, ""I don't understand either."" She decided to drop it again and said, ""Oh, you'll see when your account gets revoked!"" I ignored her and joined the class. Class was fine, instructor was great. I was leaving the gym and she was now at the front desk. As I walked by, she yelled out to me again, ""What's with all the attitude?"" Flustered, I responded, ""My attitude?"" She responded by telling me that she's suspending my account and to get out! I told her not to speak to me that way. I pay a monthly fee to use the facility. She said, ""Not anymore, get out or I'll call the cops."" Stunned, I said, ""go ahead."" The police came and questioned both of us. I told the police the following, ""I pay money to use the facility, not to be spoken to in a harassing, obnoxious, rude manner."" The police agreed and told me to follow up with the executive leadership of the company. They have received numerous complaints about the staff members in this particular location. I have no doubt that they are frustrated with the management team in this particular location. I have spoken to LA Fitness Headquarters, who informed me today that my membership has been revoked. They did not ask me what happened. They claimed they had a witness, which was an LA Fitness staff member sitting next to the lady at the front desk. This is true, but really, the witness is an LA Fitness staff member? Headquarters said that I cursed at the staff member. I did not curse. Also, I have witnesses in the class when she yelled at me in front of everyone. I know a few have even called to complain to Headquarters.I realize every story has two sides. LA Fitness doesn't care for my side. Do you, as private owners of the company care about customer service? I don't mind giving my money to another gym. NYSC is right up the block, but the way I was treated was unfair and downright wrong. At the very least, LA Fitness should ensure that staff are kind and courteous at all times with members. Everyone is entitled to a bad day, but this is embarrassing. I've never been spoken to like this in my entire life. Please let me know what I need to do to get this in front of the right people."
1111,595747,2012-06-26,1,"I purchased a training package from LA Fitness. I was told when I made the purchase that I could transfer the training to a friend in the event I could not use them all or if I were to move to an area where there were no LA Fitness locations. As luck would have it, I moved from Ft. Lauderdale, FL to Charlotte, NC. As it turned out, this is not true. In order to transfer the 108 sessions that are in my account, my friend was going to be required to purchase 4 additional sessions per month. I don't understand how something I paid for would not be transferable. I was told in no uncertain terms that training was transferable. I would use them myself, but I have moved to Charlotte, where there are no LA Fitness locations. As it stands now, my sessions will go to waste. I would not recommend that anyone join this club as its ownership/management is not trustworthy. Canceling your membership is nearly impossible. Businesses like LA Fitness will eventually not survive. Most of the people at my club in Fort Lauderdale are unhappy and looking elsewhere. Any business that has pages and pages of unhappy customers commenting on the internet is doomed to fail. Before joining a gym, look on the internet for common complaints and ask to have extra terms to the contract that you sign."

Three months after LA Fitness closed the Bally's I went to, I was told that the replacement, an LA Fitness location 2 blocks away is a ""Signature Club"". LA Fitness claims that my Bally's membership is based in a suburb 30 miles away. I have never lived in the suburbs. I have never been to the club that they claim I belonged to. I don't own a car and can't even get there. LA Fitness now said that if I want to use the location close to me, my membership will increase 4.5 times what it was before. Sounds familiar? What can you do about it? Document everything that was said to you. File a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Go to the Facebook page “LA Fitness Screws You” and tell your story. There's strength in numbers."
1114,591275,2012-06-05,1,"I have contacted LA Fitness’s call center on numerous occasions and requested that my telephone number be removed from their calling script. I contacted the local facility here in IL to cancel my membership on 3/12. I have continued receiving harassing telephone and voicemail calls from LA Fitness representatives at 503-669-8818 two to three times per day for five days a week. Today, June 4th, I called 503-669-8818 and spoke with Lauren who informed me there was nothing she could do about the nagging telephone calls until the account was updated with good information. Then she hung up on me. I called back and got Lauren again. I asked for a supervisor and was given Kevin ** who basically told me the same thing - nothing he could do. I informed Kevin I was going to file a complaint and he told me to have fun doing it. This is the worst customer service in the history of the planet!"
1115,589058,2012-05-24,1,"It appears Mr. **, the GM of the McDonough, GA location, has it out for one of the instructors. None of the instructor’s classes have A/C no matter the day. I take several classes at this facility, including one directly before, and there is always A/C until it is time for that class. In fact, the room is downright cold at some points until that class begins. We don't even have any circulation in the room as the door is closed for every class. The instructor has mentioned that the GM has promised on several occasions that there would be air for those classes, but it has not happened. I advised the instructor that I would contact the corporate office with a complaint. The Irvine corporate office's number is 949-255-7200 (option 5 may be the best); it is available from 7:00 to 5:30 PST (Monday to Thursday) and from 7:00 to 4:30 PST (Friday). "
1116,588612,2012-05-22,1,"Personal training scam! - I have long been a gym rat and an exceptionally healthy person. I even spent 3 years as a manager at Crunch Fitness on W.38th Street and can confidently say that at the very least, I am exercise savvy. I moved to Stamford and joined LA Fitness. After a few months, I decided that it was time to finally pursue my lifelong goal of training to have a 'fitness model' physique. It was a tremendous emotional decision as well as a psychological challenge to agree to undertake all the sacrifices and hard work that I knew was on its way. I met with the personal training manager ** and I explained my level of commitment and my excitement that I was finally going to do this for myself. He told me that there are 2 specific trainers that he felt would be a good match for me. When I asked why there would be 2 as I have never worked with more than 1 trainer at a time, he told me that there is no commitment to a single trainer. I expressed my concern about this because I didn't think that trading off people would be the best course for my lofty goals and I was assured that they would 'work it out'.I had my initial session with ** because he wanted to get me started right away. Then he set me up with a guy named **. I like ** very much. He had great energy and definitely had the knowledge to train me properly. However, after a few sporadic sessions with **, it became clear that his schedule was completely incompatible with mine. I expressed my concern about my lack of progress with ** due to his unavailability, so he sent me off to **.** was a nice enough guy, seemed like he was qualified but he was very mellow, not at all the energy that I needed to feel motivated. Often, when I was doing some load bearing exercises, he would be staring off into the club, speaking to someone or looking at his phone. Thankfully, I know about good form, but there were certainly quite a few times where I felt shaky and nervous that my body was going to give out. ** expressed no concern for my safety and when I placed the weights back on the floor, he said 'great job'. What? I thought I was going to drop a weight on my face! Needless to say, ** did not work out for me and add on that, he was late for several of our sessions, I was done. I went online to book a session with ** having to accept that I may only be able to train with him once a week and realizing that my lifetime goal would never be filled with this type of schedule. I had been instructed to book an appointment when the trainer has open time via his online daily sheet. He had a time open that worked for me so I booked it. I showed up at the gym and ** is training another person who he told me he has been training in that time slot for the last 3 years! Needless to say, I was really angry.So, I went back to try to figured something out with **. As it turned out, ** no longer works for LA Fitness, shocking. So I sat with **. I explained to ** that I have already wasted 6 weeks of my goal reaching trying to find someone that I can work consistently with. He asked me who ** set me up with and when I told him that it was ** and **, I could not believe his reaction. He said, 'Well, he set you up with his friends'. I was beside myself. I had spent the better part of an hour and several hundred dollars explaining and pouring my heart out to ** and he never had my best interest at heart. Let me repeat that. I explained to him that this was a lifelong goal and he set me up with his friends! I was furious!** told me that he wanted to work with me and that in fact, he was going to try to get me a partial refund for the time that I had wasted. He told me to pick a day and time and that he would train me personally. I booked and confirmed with him. I showed up for my session and there's no **. I waited for 20 minutes and I asked people at the gym if they had heard from him. No show! I left the gym in tears now knowing that my dream would once again have to be put on hold. ** sent me a text hours later apologizing that he had a family emergency and didn't have his phone with him. He asked that I give him another chance but I was more than done.When I saw him in the club a few days later, I told him that I just wanted to cancel my contract and that they had enough chances. I did not want to waste another moment of my time and emotion on these people who truly cared nothing about my actual goals. He said verbatim, ""I understand, I'll take care of it."" I asked if he could still get me a partial refund for the time I hadn't used and he said that he would 'try his best'.Needless to say, a few weeks go by and I am checking my bank statement, I had been charged $850! Two months more of training that their representative told me they were going to address. I spoke to the club manager, a true moron, named **, who simply stood behind the contract that I signed stating that I knew that I wouldn't work with the same people. I told him that was not what your representative of your organization told me. I was told that they would work around my schedule. Even the person that I was going to give another chance to failed miserably. I wasn't asking out of the contract for any other reason than I showed up. I was ready to work out, I was committed. But your staff failed to uphold their part of the contract by actually providing the service that I paid for. I explained that I was an advanced exerciser and that there was never a time that I wasn't ready to fulfill my end. He just kept repeating that you signed, therefore you owe. There's no early cancellation for training sessions and they did in fact provide the sessions for me.I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. When I got the letter from Citibank, it had LA Fitness' response simply was to put arrows pointing to my initials where I 'okay-ed' all of these conditions. So, they just told me that I had to pay because I signed. I wasn't going to let this go for $850! I let Citibank know that I was going to pursue having the charges reversed. I called their customer service line and proceeded to explain to their rep about my utter disappointment with the service that I hadn't received, in addition to being lied to by their employee. After listening to my story, the rep said, ""I'm sorry. I understand that you're frustrated but there's nothing I can do, you signed the contract."" I explained that I was deceived by their employee before I even signed the contract. And that I was fully prepared to uphold my end and their company did not fulfill theirs. He stated that the sessions are still available to me, therefore, they did indeed fulfill their end. I realized that I was getting nowhere so I asked who the manager was. He told me a woman with the last name of ** would call me. After almost 1 hour on the phone with this guy, I was no closer to solving this problem. I also never received a call from Ms. **.I called the service line a few days later and the person on the phone asked me to explain my story as there was no additional information in my account. I was amazed how the person that spent an hour talking to did not leave any notes in the computer. I said to this person that all I want is the email or fax # for Ms. **. He told me that he cannot give me that information and kept insisting that he wanted to know the reason for my call. In a tirade, I explained to him what was happening and that my $850 was at stake, and all I wanted from him was the contact info for the next highest manager. He also told me that Ms. ** would be reaching out to me, that was almost 3 weeks ago.Today, in my mail, I received the notice from my bank that they have to reverse the credit that they gave me because I 'signed the contract'. I was fuming! I haven't even stepped foot in that gym since February and as you can imagine, my goals are nowhere near coming to fruition. I feel completely and emotionally drained and feeling so sad that I spent 2 months not doing anything to fulfill my dream than chase after trainers. I know that I signed a contract, but that contract doesn't just include the number of training sessions. It included LA Fitness' obligation to give me the proper sessions that I requested. I am now $850 out of pocket, not in the body I hoped to have by this time and completely sickened by the lack of effort, compassion, and sense of 'customer service' that I have had to endure. LA fitness should be ashamed of themselves for leaving people out to dry with such an emotional and psychological toll. This is not what a fitness lifestyle company should do to people who are entrusting their bodies and minds to them!"
1117,586706,2012-05-12,2,"I have been a member of LA Fitness since it began in Harbor City. We move from California to Florida, Texas and out of the country every three months. When I enrolled, I went to the manager David and explained our situation to him. He said we could use the services anywhere in the country - no problem. Last Friday, May 11, 2012, I talked to David stating that I had to go to Florida for two weeks and that my wife would be using the service in California and I in Florida. He said okay and that all I needed was a 7-day pass for two weeks and my wife's ID. Unfortunately, she had no ID since we were at the gym. On Saturday, I again talked to the people in enrollment and the acting manager said he could not issue the pass due to the fact that my wife only has Florida ID. We have used my California ID in all the other states as well as my wife's Florida ID. He said his computer only accepts California ID and that we had to live within 20 miles of our ID to be able to use the club services. I have decided to cancel my membership and I want a full refund on the money we gave as first and last membership fees. I am sincerely looking into the idea of talking to an attorney about discrimination, lack of service and possible breach of contract in a nationwide company."
1118,584946,2012-05-03,1,"I attempted to use the Kids Klub services at LA Fitness last night and was told my membership didn't include this. The guy who signed me up a few days prior, John ""JB"" **, never mentioned this to me. Nonetheless, he came over to explain that it costs extra per month to use those services and that he told me about those fees and that I declined. It was 7:30PM and I had only 30 minutes to workout before the Kids Klub closed. I arrived with my kids and obviously, wouldn't had done so if I knew that I didn't have this service. I explained to JB that he didn't mention any of this to me during my sign up on Saturday, April 28, 2012. He persisted that he told me. I reminded him that I even asked him what the Kids Klub hours were during my sign up and he gave me the sheet with the hours on it. I had received no further information. He left me in the lobby of LA Fitness to speak with the general manager and I could hear him telling the general manager about how he told me all of this and how he was right and I was wrong. I walked over to their desk thinking they were going to take care of things or move forward with the issue but no, we basically argued over what he told me and what I heard from him on Saturday. The conversation then moved over to cancellation and I was handed a form and told they weren't going to assist me further and calling the police. Point is, they called the police, cancelled my membership and told me that I wouldn't be receiving a refund of any amounts paid on my account which consisted of first and last month's membership fees of approximately $60-65.00 because they claim that I breached my contract by arguing with JB in front of other patrons.Ideally, the situation would have gone down like this: ""Hey Melissa, sorry for this misunderstanding. Let's get you signed up real quick so you can hit that workout tonight. I can take care of the information for you while you hustle in the gym."" To be honest, that's all I was looking for. Someone to take care of the problem and let me go workout. Instead, I was called a liar by JB, store manager (male) and the receptionist (male)."
1119,583947,2012-04-28,1,"I signed up for personal training with LA Fitness, Landmark, on Little River Turnpike, Alexandria, VA. I contracted for eight paid sessions a month. I also received 12 free sessions which was mutually agreed that these sessions would be once a week for 3 months. After three sessions, the trainer failed to show up for the fourth session. He did train me the following day and threw in the next day session as compensation for blowing me off. He again failed to show up for the very next session. I complained to the Personal Training Director and he said he was short staffed and did not have a trainer for me and he agreed with me to cancel the contract. I contacted corporate and after many unturned calls, they eventually stated they would calculate how many sessions I had and would charge me accordingly. I thought this was bad business since the ink had barely dried on the contract. As I was waiting to hear back, they charged me for another month of training, which of course I never received. I called corporate and was told that a trainer was now available. I stated it had been three weeks and not only was it unacceptable to expect me to wait three weeks, but that no one had called me. I was told that I should have called the club, but I asked why should I since the last conversation I had with the director was that there were no sessions available. After numerous requests that the regional manager call me, he eventually called. However, he over spoke and was by far the rudest representative of club I had dealt with. I asked for a face to face as he had mistakenly calculated the number of sessions I had received. I insisted he pick the date and time, but he also failed to show up for our meeting. He didn't have the personal responsibility or professionalism to even call to say he was late. Two days later, he called and I was so frustrated with this matter that I just hung up on him. He called back and I told him not to call me again after he stated my account was going to collection. I had informed him, in writing, that I had disputed the charges on my credit card. In addition to the letter I sent to him, I also sent copies to the top three executives in LA Fitness, Office of Consumer Affairs - Virginia, ABC 7 News, and my credit card. I consulted with an attorney and was advised the club breached the contract, not me, and that they don't get to wait indefinitely to provide a trainer. I have decided to pursue a small claims action against them. I'm preparing for my second deployment to Afghanistan and wanted to be in top shape and had hoped using a personal trainer would facilitate my training. LA Fitness is extremely unprofessional and their lack of timely communication to resolve this issue is deplorable."
1120,583881,2012-04-28,1,"I waited in line at my local LA Fitness and had consumed too much water. After waiting for about two minutes, the clerk working the desk was still talking to the same customer. I motioned to him that I would be right back, I was just going to run to the restroom. This is the same clerk who checks me in about five days a week. As I was walking away, he yelled at me loudly, ""My man, you have to check in or I'm calling security on your **"". I told him I would be right back, I was caught off guard. I used the restroom and as I walked through the door, the same guy was standing there and informed me, ""I need your name and your telephone number so I can put notes in your account."" He also told me that all the clerks would be watching me now. I talked to his manager and he assured me the situation would be handled. As I was running on the treadmill, I noticed him waving four different members in without checking them in the system. Does anyone have a corporate number to LA Fitness so I can contact someone in the head office? I really want resolution, it is hard not to feel discriminated against."
1121,582837,2012-04-23,1,"Three months ago, Bally Fitness transferred my contract to this LA Fitness (1111 Marcus Avenue, New Hyde Park, NY 11042) without any notices. At first, they honored my old contract then they changed the terms of my membership. This basically is more like getting a new membership with them, in other words, more money. Last Saturday, when I handed my gym key card to the clerk, she was yelling out in such rude manner, ""You have to pay $5 or pay the upgrade if you want to use the facilities."" She was so nasty and clearly shouted out in front of all the people and staff that it was not her fault if I don't have the money to pay. This is unacceptable. Instead of pulling me to the side and explaining the situation, she completely embarrassed me in front of everybody. She never apologized to me not even once. Next Monday, I called the manager to complain about it. Basically, the same nasty and mean attitude. They should be fired for the lack of customer service and respect for a client. They get paid because of us, and they should work in a DMV. I felt very discriminated by these people."
1122,581226,2012-04-17,2,"Last month, I renewed my old contract from previously known Bally Fitness. At first, they gave a hard time and then they honored my old contract. When I went to renew my daughter's contract, the manager had such a nasty attitude and clearly shouted out in front of all the people and staff that my daughter's contract could not be renewed as mine was. One of their staff told him that they could, but he insisted that it will not renew and provided his business card when I told him that I would complain against him. He seemed not to care. He is the general manager and is located at 14100 SW 8st. He should attend an angry management class and customer service class as well. It is a shame that I paid a full year already with that identity."
1123,581104,2012-04-17,2,"On the day of April 16, 2012, at around 5:30 pm, I walked in with my little ones into the LA Fitness located at 3176 Northlake Boulevard, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33403 (registration no. HS5825). This was the first time I brought my babies (3) with me to this particular gym. Unfortunately, I was in for a big surprise. Becoming a member at this particular LA Fitness, the sales team offered a discounted rate for the Kids Klub. In addition, I was receiving the first 6 months of Kids Klub for free! So when I finally decided to bring my kiddies with me, the OM (as she calls herself) by the name of ** completely humiliated me and my kids. It all came about when my kids and I walked in to the gym and I handed my gym key card to **. ** then asked for the Kids Klub (without eye contact) key card. I handed over my card the sales team gave me for the Kids Klub and she (**) went insane. She yelled out in such rude manner, ""Who would give out 6 months of free Kids Klub? Whoever did this is in major trouble. I don’t believe this. This is unbelievable. This is unacceptable."" Instead of ** pulling me to the side and explaining the situation, she completely embarrassed me. As of right now, I am looking into cancelling my membership and taking my business elsewhere. Never in my life have I ever felt so degraded."
1124,580604,2012-04-16,1,"I took a cycle class as usual. A sub was there and proceeded to tell us her style of riding. I, myself, a beginner, was doing my best to keep up and she asked me if I was just doing my own thing because when I take her class, I cycle the way she's teaching it. I told her when she pays my membership, I will cycle anyway she wants me to. I told the management. At first, they were surprised that she spoke to me that way. But when I checked up on whether they spoke to her, they were trying to justify her actions. I felt very dismissed and that she had every right to do what she did. Any other cycle class I have ever took, the instructor tells us it's our ride and do the best you can do. She won't keep me from cycling, but I don't understand where the loyalty lays. The member or the rude instructors?"
1125,580250,2012-04-14,1,"LA Fitness in Clifton, NJ - I joined LA fitness some time ago. I go in to do what I have to do and I leave. A friend of mine was thinking about joining so I offered her my buddy pass. A sales associate wanted to talk to her about joining. She let them know that she won't be making any decisions until she tries the gym. My friend is in pretty good shape since she works outdoors in NYC and has to walk a lot throughout the day. The sales associate went on and on saying that she has the type of body that will be prone to getting fat and that if she doesn't join a gym that she will become fat and unhealthy and her body will become deformed so that she needs to hand over her credit card so that doesn't happen. Are you kidding me, LA Fitness? What in the ** kind of selling is that? It was derogatory and rude. After she told him, ""No, I will not give you my credit card and now I really don't want to join,"" he insisted she go try out the gym. But as she was trying to work with the equipment, he kept on coming by and harassing us, telling her to join and to give up the credit card and mentioned again that she is going to get fat. I went to the manager and he was completely ignoring me as I was trying to tell him my complaint. I left furious. I cancelled my membership (which is another song and dance and from what I hear there is a class action suit because of the policies) and will never recommend this gym to anyone ever again. They are abusive, rude and sleazy."
1126,578908,2012-04-10,1,"Dissatisfied and treated wrongly: The same stalker, **, crowded me again today. I was absolutely upset because this man will not stop and Ryan nor the other acting manager did the fair thing. As I was pumping out hand sanitizer to clean the machine, Mr. ** stood up about 2 feet behind me and wouldn't move. He has no regard for personal space and is very passive aggressive. He won’t speak, but he'll crowd me on purpose. I had to say something rude for him to go away. I spoke with a woman who speaks to Mr. ** the other day (I wasn't aware that she was friends with him as he was stalking me) about the incident because I thought I knew her as just someone friendly I can speak to from time to time. But the day I mentioned his behavior to her, she got defensive and said, ""Well, he doesn't do that to me.” Please keep in mind that since the incident, several women have come up to me and complained about **, saying the same thing. She was being difficult about what I was saying as if to say I think I'm cute, so I'm just stating that this grown man is stalking me to look like I am! This whole thing is disgusting. I stopped talking to her after that because she made it seem as though she was angry that I had a stalker and she didn't. I let her know that there's nothing cute about it and that she can have one if she wants. No problem! Continuing on where Mr. ** finally walked away today - I had had enough of him, so I decided that I would take out my camera and act like I was taking his photo, solely to make him feel uncomfortable because he apparently just can’t stop. In the anxiousness of the moment, I told two trainers who I sometimes speak with that I had taken his photo. I said this because the grapevine in there is so small I was hoping that word would circulate and Mr. ** would finally leave me alone. He only does things like this when he sees that Herbert has gone home. He keeps his eyes open for things like that. I spoke with him the day he got back to work about being harassed by Mr. ** and several incidents have been reported. The woman walked behind me saying my name and when I turned, she asked if I took her photo. I started to say no, but her voice began escalating as she was being rude. So I said very calmly, “Listen, this is really none of your business and has nothing to do with you.” I continued walking to the locker room and she started shouting at me, ""You don't go in there, you don't go in there."" It was embarrassing, really. Then the managers came in and asked what was going on and she jumped in and said, ""She's taking pictures of me. I want her to get rid of them."" I let them know that I didn't take any photos and Ryan told me to go ahead to the locker room. I don't trust him too well either. He was too lackadaisical about the whole thing the last time I had made a complaint about Mr. **.There were women in there asking about what just happened and I didn't have a minute to change when a young female trainer walked in and said that Ryan (one of the acting managers) wanted to speak with me. I got my things together and sat down with both Ryan and the other manager. I asked him for information about the dates, times and complaint list that were made about Mr. ** and he said, ""We can’t give you information on another member."" I said I didn't ask for his information, but I do know that it’s my right to have documentation on the list of complaints that were made about Mr. **. He looked at me a bit surprised and continued to half way lie and distract from my question. He acted like he didn't know how to spell **, but when he got to his name, he said, ""There's nothing here on him."" I said, ""What? You were supposed to document that the last time I complained! What's going on? Now, I really don't feel safe here!” He said, ""Well, I've heard from two trainers that you took pictures of Mr. ** and that’s against club policy."" I let him know that photos weren't actually taken and that I was acting out so that Mr. ** might actually stop his nonsense. I offered to show him my photos and he rejected several times to look! He asked me to leave. I told him I didn't think it was right that he would do that and I feel like I may need a lawyer. And I saw that Mr. ** was talking to them after I had left to get the rest of my things from the locker room. He had a satisfied look on his face as he went back to exercise/woman watch. I said to Ryan, ""Why is he still here and you're asking me to go home?"" He said something that sounded like because he's not bothering anybody. It was muffled and said under his breath so I couldn't hear.I was so angry I had to leave at that point. As I got home, I called a fellow trainer who's a friend of mine and asked her if she knew Herbert's number (meaning his cell phone number) so that I can tall him what happened. She didn't have it. But not knowing the complete story of what happened, she asked Ryan for Herb's number and Ryan - knowing Herb wouldn't want to be disturbed at home - gave her Herbert's home number. I called and understandably Herbert was upset that I had called his home number and I explained how sorry I was and that I thought it was his cell phone. I felt so stupid and completely out of luck. I know now that I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands and take this to the police. This is ridiculous and disgusting behavior both by Mr. **, that woman, and Ryan. I feel disrespected and at a loss. Mr. ** should be the one to have his membership revoked, not me."
1127,578534,2012-04-08,1,"Today, they threatened me if I do not give them a credit card number, that they would be revoking my membership. I do not give anybody my credit card number over the phone, and especially not to Bally/LA Fitness. Also, they are very rude, and the manager was not available because it is Sunday, and also Easter. But they have the guts to call customers on Easter Sunday to threaten them. I was a member with Bally Rancho Palos Verdes, CA since February 2005, but I think I will say good bye to them, because this whole merger is a big disaster."
1128,577479,2012-04-04,1,"On April 3, 2012, while visiting L.A. Fitness on Old National Highway in College Park, GA, on a guest pass, my car and 13 others were burglarized within an hour's time. It was brought to our attention by the police officer, members of LA Fitness, and a customer service representative, that the thefts have been going on since December 2011. I am appalled that since December over 50 burglaries have been reported and LA Fitness has not established that a security guard is a necessity on the outside premises. Considering that the patrons pay monthly membership fees, it would be sensible that a reputable institution would consider the livelihood of its consumers. Simple question, while LA Fitness is extending admirable commercials and plans for the physical well being of its members and guests, why not protect/secure their material property while on the premises? Patrol your lots and protect your patrons! I look forward to your response to my question and concerns. "
1129,577203,2012-04-03,2,"Incident took place on March 29, 2012 at the LA Fitness Carmel West location. My buddy and I wanted to play racquetball and he was assured that we had a reservation for today between 6pm and 8pm. When we reached there, we were told that there were no courts available. When asked why this happened (and this was the second time at the same location), they said they did not know who took the reservation and that there was nothing they could do about it. Furthermore, they said that we were in lucky to be using their location since we had a full paid membership at another location. Expressing our dissatisfaction that this had happened a second time, we said that the least that LA Fitness could do is apologize and compensate us for the trouble. We were also told that we did not have the privilege to reserve courts last week upon which an additional money was put on the membership to guarantee us of this privilege only to find out that we still did not have a court. After much debate, the individual literally told us in plain English to get out, threatened to call the cops on us and revoke our membership for life. Sorry to say, but LA Fitness has caused me deep distress especially after being a long term patron of this club and my family who loves going there. I am sure it is only this one individual that is tarnishing its reputation and demand a personal apology from the individual. If not, I will cancel my membership and hopefully everyone else who reads this will do so too. Also if I'm not allowed to play in that location, how come they charged me for having court reserve facility? The credit card payment info is attached at the bottom."
1130,576826,2012-04-02,1,"I bought a house in Boca Raton, Florida, but I live full time in Honduras. I bought a membership in LA Fitness in East Boca Raton in June 2011. The salesman told me that if I did not use the membership while I was away, it would be kept on hold until I returned to Boca. They billed me every month, but I was unaware of it because my accountant receives the statements. I also bought 10 personal training lessons for $36 each or $360. I have no problem with that. However, I am being billed each month for $360 and I have not been back to Boca since July or August of 2011. I want my money refunded for the personal training sessions I did not receive after my first session."
1131,575934,2012-03-30,1,"Today, March 29, 2012, an incident took place at my local LA Fitness. This is another branch of LA Fitness that I decided to use since it is the only one that has racquetball courts. Despite assuring me that the courts were reserved, my buddy and I were disappointed to hear that there were no courts available. Since this was the second time this was happening, we were very disappointed. Also, my friend had recently paid an extra $26 to activate the privilege to reserve courts. When we started questioning the front desk personnel about our dissatisfaction, one particular individual simply told us to get out and threatened to call the cops on us. Perhaps a more cordial tone of explaining the mix-up and apologizing for the same would've saved their day, but there is no excuse for this kind of behavior with one's customers. Upon further discussion, the individual threatened to cancel/revoke our membership. As my friend and I stormed out of there, we swore to cancel our membership anyway. It is sad because both my friend and I are long time patrons of the health club and this one individual has ruined it all. We got home and called LA Fitness’ headquarters and the club location where I actually obtained membership and they have promised to resolve the situation, but nothing as of yet. Honestly, I don't have any hope of resolution. Never ever become a member of LA Fitness. Trust me, you will regret it! By the way, the location where this incident took place is in Carmel West on Michigan 10574 Workout Way, Carmel, IN."
1132,575842,2012-03-29,1,"You don't have USA. You have UK and other countries. I want to file a complaint against LA Fitness. Their clubs are dirty, no hygiene is maintained, and staff changes happen very fast. They are only taking money. There is no paper towel and no clean bathroom."
1133,575213,2012-03-27,2,"Before LA Fitness took over Bally, I was able to go to the gym and work out and it was a TV that works on every station. Now, I go to the gym and the TVs only have 3 channels on. I pay the same amount on my membership and I feel I don't get the same quality with LA Fitness. And there are no juice bars in these gyms. "
1134,575141,2012-03-27,1,"I never knew the hot water I'd get in at a local gym, until I waded into a hot tub and saw one of the gym staffers assault a fellow bather when he paid more attention to the person he was speaking to via headphones than the operations manager, who yanked at his headset, telling him to get the hell out. He yelled at the staffer, a woman, and warned her never to touch anyone the way she had grabbed the headphones. It turned out that she pulled a wire and broke the $300 device before calling the police on us and threatening to strip us of our gym memberships for not responding to her demands. Philadelphia cops, however, appeared at the scene and advised the young man, a 6-foot 8-inch professional basketball player, how he could file a private criminal complaint against the manager. I gave a statement and called the corporate headquarters, asking for immediate action against the woman. Not once during the episode did she identify her self as a manager. She repeatedly refused to show me any identification when threatening to revoke my membership at the LA Fitness Center in the Andorra section of Philadelphia.How did this all come about? The hot tub had been closed and barricaded for use the past four weeks as repairmen worked diligently to fix whatever problems they discovered. Today, the yellow tape surrounding the tub had been removed, and persons entered the tub for a good soaking. There was nary a sign anywhere cautioning bathers to keep out.I had worked out on the treadmill 25 minutes and swam a half-mile over another 25-minute spree, when I slunk my body into the bubbling water with jet air shooting streams of pulsating pleasure onto my back, hip, and other sore spots. I had been soaking, paying no mind to the African-American male at the other side of the pool who was in deep conversation on what I took to be a business call.No more than five to seven minutes had passed when a person I had never seen before approached the side of the tub and told me I had to leave. I had just begun to meditate and had yet to calm down from the nearly hour-long stress I had subjected my body to. It was an Asian woman who spoke to me. I didn't understand what she said. I thought she was one of the cleaning staff. This gym retains a lot of Hispanics for housekeeping, and I stupidly stereotyped her as a member of the gyms housekeeping staff.She said there was no chlorine in the hot tub. So what, I thought. She said we could introduce germs into the water. Again, I thought, so what. I even played lawyer with her, telling her that I'd waive the right to bring any charges against the gym should I get a contagious disease from my fellow bather, who had to lift up the side of his headphones to make out what she was saying.The tub is situated in a closed section of the gym next to two shower stalls. An Olympic-size swimming pool occupies the great bulk of the room, and it is difficult to hear because of the constant running of water and the echo sound each word creates when someone speaks. Then she threatened to call the police if I didn't get out of the pool. I heard that loud and clear and told her Id get out once she got my fellow bather out. Off she stormed, ordering him out, and grabbed the headphones when she claimed he ignored her, when in reality, he was still speaking to someone else. She yanked at the headset. Now, there are certain things you simply don't do in the United States. Jim Croce, a Philadelphia-area singer who has since passed away, put it this way: You don't tug on Superman's cape. You don't spit in the wind. You don't pull ... the mask ... of the ole Lone Ranger. And, you don't mess around with Jim. Well, here, you could put the name of most men wearing headphones and trying to relax after a hard workout at the gym. You don't mess around by yanking at an object that is an extension of the work-outer.He yelled at her but never cursed. She told him to get the hell out of the tub, and at least one of the swimmers in the pool overheard this and reported it to the police. I'm sure she gave a different story to the authorities. I kind of felt sorry for her, because she handled the incident so badly and probably saw nothing wrong with using force, no matter how slight, to demand someone else's attention. You can't do that and expect cooperation with your management style.The young man, who plays for an international team out of Venezuela, exchanged e-mails with me; and I agreed to assist in any action against the gym manager. He might file a private criminal complaint if he couldn't get restitution for the expensive headphones. I'd settle for a corporate manager to investigate this and ensure that nothing like this ever happened again. Hot tubs were made for relaxation, not consternation."
1135,573154,2012-03-20,1,"I joined LA Fitness in August and enrolled to pay a $30 monthly fee. By December, I have paid 6 months (2 months when I enrolled and 4 month after that). In December, they are having a special that 4 people can join to get a lower monthly fee of $20 but need to pay $200 enrollment fee. 3 friends and I switch to the lower monthly fee program and shared the cost of the $200. The sales manager promised that my previous payment (2 months of fee when I paid in August) will be refunded and took away my old fitness card and gave me a new one. When the LA fitness in Renton Fairwood opened in January 2, I went to ask the operation manager when my two months will be refunded. She told me only one month can be refunded. I explained to her I have paid 6 months since August to December and then started to pay in January under my new plan. So I have paid 2 months extra. She told me she would request the headquarters to give me the refund. She told me in person that ""it will be taken care of”. 2 weeks later, when I check with her, she told me it is pending for approval. Another week passed, I asked her again and she told me it won't happen. She gave me the same reason she gave me 3 weeks ago. I really don't think she ever tried to get my refund for me at all. So I told her I would cancel my new membership, too. Overall, I have paid $150 for the first membership and $100 for the 2nd membership for a total usage of 6 months. And between December 14 to January 2, I couldn't use the gym because the old membership key was taken away and the new membership hasn't been activated. I really don't know if the franchise owner has any idea what is going on in the gym. With this kind of bad business ethic, I don't think the gym will last long. This is sad because we do want to have a nice gym in our area."
1136,572525,2012-03-17,1,"I'd like to point out before this letter continues that I've enjoyed being a member at LA Fitness for almost two years and have recruited three people; therefore, generating more business for the company. Sad to say, I have not been made to feel like a valued customer. I am a member at the Brandon, Florida location of LA Fitness and have been stalked numerous amounts of times by two specific men. I have complained (depending on the situation) numerous times about both men but nothing has been done. Just tonight, I had a run in with one man, last name was **. He's acting in a passive aggressive nature by walking close by me, watching what I do--in an inappropriate way and just being creepy!For example, as I was working on back strengthening exercises, he'd watch me as I bend forward (disgusted). I walked away and watched to see if he was gone. There was a trainer helping me out that day and I pointed Mr. ** out to him. When I thought Mr. ** was gone, I turned to my right and there he was, staring at me, sitting to my right side, now behind the trainer. I pointed this out to the trainer too.Another instance is that since he watches me so closely, he knows my routine. I was on the Stairmaster (which is a new thing for him) and I left to get alcohol to clean the machine. I saw a bottle and didn't know whose it was. I moved it politely and began cleaning. Just then, I see him standing too close right behind me after I've already complained about him. Many other women have complained about this same man making them feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly, I may end up cancelling my membership as they have because I'm in fear of my safety. So much that I told one of the police officers who works out there the story. And before going to the women's locker room, I asked to be escorted there.He approached me today because he heard me--as he was passing by deliberately too close--that he is my stalker. He said, ""Young lady, I need to speak with you."" I said (in a loud voice), ""I'm not talking to you because you're a stalker. You know, I'm not comfortable with you and now, you're invading my space to talk to me? Go away!"" He then proceeded to follow me. I turned and said, ""You're following me again? And still talking to me? I have a problem with you.""I proceeded to the front desk and began telling the management what was happening, making sure to mention that he has harassed me in front of a trainer before and that this is the third time I've reported him. I feel unsafe to go through my daily routine because If he has gal enough to invade my personal space in such a disrespectful way, what's next? I have to bring my cell phone with me and take pictures of him if he gets too close!Why should I be made to feel uncomfortable? What he's doing is against the law and is causing me great discomfort. I heard he was saying, ""She better stop talking about it."" I'd better? So now he's threatening me through another source? Please make this stop. He also told the management that he owns his own business (just so he could add value to his case). I just looked Mr. ** up in my Google search engine and couldn't find any businesses he owns. Please revoke his membership or I will need to leave the gym as other women have for the same reason. Thank you."
1137,572400,2012-03-17,2,"Pool water temperature is well below 80 degrees, especially 3 days a week when tested and cold water is pumped in. Staff and pool tech insist temperature is 82. The tech was heard to say we who complain are “whiners” and many do complain. The hot tub is also below the norm and at times is closed. Surely, the best time to tend the pool is late to allow time to warm up. The facility is clean and the staff friendly, but that doesn't help my arthritis when I can't tolerate the cold pool."
1138,572282,2012-03-16,2,"Since LA Fitness has taken over the Bally's Club, the new staff is very cordial, and proficient. They are to be commended. But, since LA Fitness has taken over the Bally Club, the first floor area has become a veritable pig pen! The floor area is dirty and dusty, the restrooms are odorous (health issue?), weights, dumbbells, barbells, equipment handles, mats, step supports, steps, and empty water bottles are strewn about all over the place. And some members have even gone so far as to move the equipment to other locations of their choosing. Something must be done about these violations because not only are these abuses unsightly, but accident, safety, and health hazards abound, as in mishaps waiting to happen."
1139,571979,2012-03-16,1,Staff does not want you to work out with your friends. They are rude. They will not show you how to use the machine without trying to sell you a trainer. They don't want to hear you tell your partner to push because then you will be training them. They violate my first amendment rights and freedom of speech.
1140,571525,2012-03-14,1,"They have not been able to provide me with any signed contract and are charging me more than what I was told would be my monthly fee. They did not honor any of the previous Bally membership agreements. They only take cancelled membership through their offices (in person from 9 am to 5 pm) or by mail. I work 9 to 5 and can not take time off to cancel a membership. I mailed cancellation to them, but they continue to bill me and say they never received the cancellation. After calling back, they stated they may have lost my cancellation. Now, they want to charge me for cancelling, except they never cancelled anything. Add me to a class action."
1141,571014,2012-03-13,2,"I've been requesting a copy of my contract (a.k.a. agreement). Apparently, since this was done so long ago, over 16 years, before they had an electronic system in place apparently, it is impossible to get it. I went to a branch and they told me that I needed to contact corporate. I called corporate and they told me that I needed to go into the branch. Ah, bureaucracy at its best! I guess that’s what I get for being a loyal customer for 16 years!"
1142,570144,2012-03-10,1,"After a year of not using my gym membership and still paying for it, I finally decided to cancel it completely. I went through their outrageous system of canceling my gym membership online along with my personal training online and submitting their forms. In addition, to avoid being charged by them, I went ahead and changed my debit card number with my bank. About a week later, LA Fitness emailed me a cancellation for my membership but never sends me an email regarding the training. I find it funny that they received one form, but not the other. Even after the cancellation email, a month later, low and behold, they begin charging my card. Would you know, they tracked down MasterCard and made them give up my information, which I found out they could do it because they had a contract with me. What Mastercard didn't know was that my contract was actually cancelled. Now, I have over $300 that they've taken out of my account in random charges none of which amount to what my training charge had been or even my gym membership has been. They even took out $5 for who knows what. I am beyond angry with LA Fitness at this point and I'm now in the process of closing down my bank account, which stinks because I actually liked my bank and they had absolutely nothing to do with LA Fitness' wrongdoing. They're crooks, plain and simple."
1143,569122,2012-03-07,1,"I wanted to join LA Fitness, so my husband decided to surprise me with a membership. He told them it was a surprise, and to not contact me. Right before Christmas, I got a call from a trainer to set up a session. I told him I wasn't a member, but he assured me I was. I realized it was a surprise, but he insisted on making an appointment, which I declined. I went in after New Year's. He spent half an hour going over goals, etc, and then gave me a mini workout of 5 exercises, involving 2 machines, and then tried a hard sell for personal trainer. I wasn't interested, but he insisted and called back several times. I had no tour of the facility, or review of the various machines. When I asked for a demo of equipment, he said read the description on the machine. I went back couple of weeks later, and talked to the desk, and asked for an ""orientation"" and tour, and they said what I had gotten was it. They don't demonstrate the equipment, unless I buy the trainer. I told them Healthtrax and other gyms do, but LA doesn't. I said I wanted to cancel my membership and go back to Healthtrax, and they said okay. Apparently, LA doesn't need my business. I should have listened to others who dropped them (including PTs)! Healthtrax is much better!"
1144,569057,2012-03-07,2,"When my fiancee and I joined Mount Laurel, we paid for a full facility, as described by our salesperson Chris **. The pool has been out of commission for close to three weeks now. We figured we would go to Cherry Hill to swim, and lo and behold, their pool has been down since August. A good business would at least offer some sort of compensation. Health clubs are pretty competitive, and LA Fitness is going to bury themselves, if they don't pay attention."
1145,568991,2012-03-07,4,"LA Fitness in North Brunswick, NJ is not being maintained. My husband who is also a member tells me the men's locker room has missing doors on the lockers, broken soap dispensers in the shower stalls, etc. There are doors missing on the lockers in the women's section also. The floors in the main classroom needed to be cleaned more than once a day and the facility needs cleaning on the weekends. Recently, since Bali members have been coming in, I think there is a cleaning staff on weekends but a major complaint is lack of cleaning of the entire facility. The front desk is of no help when it comes to maintenance. They are polite, etc, but nothing is addressed."
1146,568034,2012-03-04,1,"A co-worker for my school decided we should workout together seeing we have the same membership. I haven't worked out in a couple of months because of a knee injury that I still have to this day. I need total knee replacement surgery in my right knee. The first night we worked out, I couldn't work out because of my pain. The next time we worked out, an assistant manager told me to workout with my partner or I will be asked to cancel my membership, so I did. The big manager came over and told me and my partner that we can not workout together because I am training her. She then asked me why I was doing the same amount of weight as my partner. I told her about the ""use it or lose it"" principle. I was away for awhile without working out so I want to take it slow. The lady manager threatened me if we workout again, I would be let go. I don't understand how she makes money trying to manipulate people into using their personal trainers. You pay money to workout and socialize with one another and this club takes it to a new level. They even questioned me about keeping a personal log for myself. I was told trainers use those, but as an adult that always changes up his exercises wants to keep track of his weight he last used, number of reps and sets. I am a physical education teacher so I know what I'm doing. My partner and I have not traded any money with one another. The LA Fitness location is: Spring 20127 Interstate 45 North Spring, TX 77388."
1147,567973,2012-03-03,1,"Back in 1997 I went and bought a Premier Plus membership from Bally’s which allowed to me to use all clubs in the US and internationally and was also transferable to another person in case I needed to sell it. Now, I try to renew the membership with LA Fitness and they expect me to pay $30/month for access to one single club when I used to pay $99 a year with Bally’s. This is a scam and very low business practice."
1148,567938,2012-03-03,1,"I attend the gym at Poway. It's close to home and on my way to work, I also attend another gym near my office. The difference is night and day. The Poway gym is a cesspool with deplorable maintenance and rude staff. I blame it all on management because they have a very high turnover rate on staff, but the ones that stay are indoctrinated into the rude, dismissive attitude characteristic of the gym. My main concern is that there is a health hazard as they always have a jacuzzi that is filthy, there is scum floating and a thick film of ** around the edge, the water is usually 4"" - 6"" low and instead of draining the jacuzzi scrubbing and filling with clean water twice a week, they just over chlorinate to the point that your eyes water just from standing 2 - 4 feet from the jacuzzi. Many of the shower drains don't flush and the dirty drain water pools and one has to stand in filthy water, the sauna light bulb has been out for weeks and the room is dirty, the lockers haven't been cleaned inside for many months, etc. Management doesn't care about any of this and is always dismissive, rude and derogatory to customers for bringing any of this to their attention. The manager just sits all day and is more interested in talking to girls and selling supplements out of the trunk of his car. This is a service based membership and the only thing not offered is good customer service. What kind of business?"
1149,566496,2012-02-28,2,"The girls at the front desk just take your keys, don't look at you, and don't say anything. If this is the welcoming attitude, it is not very good. Our swimming class ladies all were talking about it today, so I am not the only one. They need to be trained in customer service. This is at the Vancouver LA Fitness on 4th Plain. "
1150,566479,2012-02-28,1,"I was a loyal club member for over 4 years. Unfortunately, I have to cancel it last year, because of my puppy. Now my puppy is fully independent, so I want to re-join the club again. Your club is always my first choice of course, even though 24-Hour Fitness has an unbeatable deal in Costco. So yesterday (2/27/12), me and my friend went to the Arcadia club, tried to talk to somebody, at around 7:30PM. The staff's name is Jonny **. He was okay at the first few minutes, asking about what kind of deals we are looking for. But for some reasons, he was not able to pull out the right record of my previous information. I was telling him I used to have a $29.99 per month membership, and I can bring a friend with me. He said that was not in the system, and you didn't have this offer. My friend went to this club with me before I cancelled it, so she couldn't believe his reply. By all means, I was with the club for 4 years, I know what I had before, and my friend is the witness. We went to this club together more than 20 times! So I asked if I can get this deal again, but he didn't give me direct answers. He's just saying that was not what I had. Then my friend said ""well then, we'll go to 24-Hour Fitness"". He said, ""if you can't afford LA Fitness, then go to 24-Hour Fitness"". We couldn't believe that was coming from your ""friendly, professional, trained"" staff! I replied, ""it's not about I can afford it or not, I just want to know if I can get the same deal that I used to have"". Jonny wasn't apologizing for what he just said, and said, ""I can't give you the deal that you imagine you had"". So we left the club feeling very insulted. I can't believe that how can LA fitness has someone like Alex, treat your previous member, and possibly new members in such a way! What kind of staff do you guys hire for such a nice location?I'm sincerely asking your attention to do something about this matter. I feel like me and my friend will never go with LA Fitness again, and we'll tell all my friends how we were treated at your Arcadia club. This makes your business looks very bad. Fitness clubs require high quality trained professional staff, who are in contact with clients. We are just two young girls, with a simple request, and the result doesn't even matter at this point. If this is the kind of staff your club hires, you'll lose more business in the future. This is the worst experience I have ever had at any kind of business. Not even a small restaurant will treat their customers like this."
1151,566439,2012-02-28,1,"I signed up in December 2011 and have been passed through four different trainers and today it is February 28, 2012 and my fourth trainer was assigned in January 2012. Every time I showed up after rushing in from work, after an hour and 15 minute, I drive only to wipe in and stand there looking stupid because my trainer was not there and no one knew anything of his whereabouts or was the least bit interested in assisting me. Later, number one quit. Number 2 went on vacation and said never put me back on his schedule. Why? I don't know. But maybe because I told him that I was 47 and not 27. He worked me out like a slave the first night and I couldn't walk up my steps for three days. Now I appreciate him working with me and doing his job, but really it was over board. I sucked it up and said okay, I'll get better. But he never put me back on his schedule. The next guy made all these big promises of how he was going to work with me to meet my goals but after he did not show up for three sessions, I was told that he was moved to another gym. Then guy number 4. I enjoyed this one, oh, but not for long. They fired him and never told me, put me back on schedule, returned my phone calls, but one thing for sure that $133 came out of my account without skipping a beat. I was angry because really from December 7 through the first week of February. I wrote a complaint letter to their corporate office and sent it certified another $7 or so. They received the letter on 2/23 signed by a G. ** at 11:02 am. No one ever called me at all. I called today 2/28/2012 because I was tired of playing with these clowns. A man answered the phone and asked for my phone number and pulled up my account and said, ""What was your complaint?"" and they never acknowledged the letter being received. I told him that I had sent in a letter and and told him who signed for it and he just pretended like that didn't matter. He listened to my complaints and he did apologize but that was it. Canceling my contract was not an option. He said that he would contact the local manager in the Conyers facility to discuss it with him and he would personally call me back. I did get a call back in about 2 minutes. He may have still been on the other line. The call came from the local office. Now, I had been calling all month with no returned call. I spoke with the manager and he said, ""Hey there, this is Daryl and I am called to put you back on the schedule for your personal training class,"" just as if I wasn't upset or as if there was no prior discussion of this matter. I rescheduled with him, after being assured that I was clearly in a contract that I was obligated to honor but clearly they can do what ever they want to and it's okay. I am going to sadly have to ride this one out, but **"" on me once, but never again. I used to attend the YMCA and I wish I would have stayed with them. I was never under any contract. It was month to month and the machines in that facility kept track of your process and told you what you needed to work on to meet your goals. You went in and filled out a profile stating your goals and weight. You were guided through this procedure with a personal trainer. Each time you came into the gym, you went to a central log in machine and it would give you your work out schedule for that day. I wish I would have stayed with that. The machine was a better personal trainer than the humans."
1152,566280,2012-02-28,1,"I went in the Orange, CT LA Fitness tonight at around 8:30. I wanted to talk to someone about starting up a new membership. I was greeted by a young gentlemen named Gabriel. First thing he asked me was if I was going to judge him because he was outside smoking. I said no why would I do that? Then he asked me if I had ever been there before, I said yes I was here several years ago inquiring about membership and I received a tour then, but I never actually signed up. At that time the membership was $39.95 a month plus some extra sign up fees. He then proceeded to ask me if I still wanted to take a tour. I asked him if anything has changed in the last like 7 years, he said nah not really. I said to him that I really wanted to find out what the monthly fees were. He showed me the price packages that were offered but they were completely different than what was offered online. So I told him, I wanted to pay $19.95 like it said online but he told me in order to pay that price I would have to pay a $200 initiation fee first. Then he said, If I wanted to pay $100 initiation fee, the monthly fee would be $30. I was paying that at the Edge, that was the whole reason why I left because I wanted to save some money and get a lower rate. When I wouldn't budge, he told me that he would waive the $100 fee and I could still pay $30 a month. Again, I said no thank you because I wanted the price I saw online, so then he threw in a free once a month Kids Klub pass. He said that he didn't want to argue with me and he was trying not to be rude. I thought his attitude was extremely cocky and he acted like he didn't want to be there. My whole experience was very unprofessional. That might work on a 19 year old who doesn't know any better but that doesn't work on me. I came home and went online to make sure I wasn't seeing things when I saw that deal and I found the same offer, $0 initiation fee and $19.90 a month with it being deducted out of my account bi-weekly for $9.95. I was starting to sign up online to get the offer I had originally asked for but I was so turned off by my experience there that I decided not to join."

As it turns out, this area is a safe haven for criminals to commit burglaries inside and out of the gym facility. Why? Because there are no camera surveillance in the parking lot, lobby or workout areas to help protect their customers. The parking location does not even have a security guard patrolling the lot, which they should, considering the volume of burglaries that have occurred in the past year. Prior to this criminal act, I held this specific gym in high regard. The Valencia area is very nice and the gym is clean with state of the art equipment and a great set up. I've been going to this gym for the past 2 years. However, on this day, I went in at 6:00PM for an evening workout. I went to the women's locker room, placed my purse, sweater and jacket in one of their lockers and locked it with my personal lock. An hour and a half later, I walked in and my belongings were gone. I started looking in every locker in panic and realized that I was robbed! I immediately ran to the front desk and alerted the staff of the crime. I was astounded by their nonchalant reaction. The two young female employees had a very apathetic attitude, but accompanied me back to the locker room minutes later. There, we checked all the lockers, bathroom, sauna, pool area, everywhere and there was no sign of my items. I was left stranded with no purse, cell phone, car keys, everything was gone! I immediately contacted my family to come pick me up and contacted my banks to cancel all my credit cards from the gym phones. By the time we went back to check the areas for my stolen items, it was closing time. I think any real good gym that strives on customer service and care would have remained behind with me until the police or family showed up. But no, 10 minutes after closing time, I was asked to leave. Are you serious? After these circumstances, you are asking me to leave? Are you freaking kidding me? Leave after I did everything right to prevent a crime like this from happening? I left a note behind with the gym to call me at home. I waited outside for my family to show up and called the sheriff's department after. The deputy did inform me that this location was in high alert for the massive amounts of car and gym burglaries they've experienced.The following morning at 8:30AM, I received a phone call from the gym. They found my purse. I rushed over there and spoke to their sales manager. She gave me the purse, but all my valuable belongings were gone. The only thing that was in there were my car keys. I was told that the purse was found in the women's bathroom after I checked there thoroughly the night before. I'm starting to suspect this is an inside job. I have kept the officers apprised on this matter since. I am very disappointed and angry on how poorly the gym faculty has handled my case. They didn't even report it to their headquarters until 5 days later. The mere fact that they don't have any surveillance in their facility speaks volumes on how minimal they view their customers. Unlike LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness does have surveillance in their facilities and outside their parking lots. This in itself says a lot about their customer care. I have been an LA Fitness member for over 8 years but as of today, I will be cancelling my membership. I advise the public to be aware, come together and demand security surveillance in the gyms operating hours to ensure that the safety and property of their loyal customers remains unscathed."
1154,566041,2012-02-27,1,"Buyers, beware! This is a horrible experience! It is probably the most unethical fitness facility. We became members, and the sales agents signed us up for personal training sessions, which we found we could never use, because one, most of the trainers are not well trained themselves, and two, the ones who are trained are never available. The sales agent told me we could cancel at any time, which I found when we went to cancel is untrue, because they suddenly show you the fine print, which says to cancel, you owe them 50% of the balance, something they never tell you when they make you sign up. They have no customer service and are most unprofessional. It makes one wonder what the health of American business is today."
1155,566035,2012-02-27,1,"I called LA Fitness, after I learned of their acquisition of Bally, because I had both memberships. The representative told me that I have a better deal from my Bally contract, and that she would cancel my LA Fitness membership, and that I would be issued a new card on my next visit. Everything went well, and I had been visiting the gym for a couple weeks. However, one day, I was told that I no longer had access. This particular gym was now a signature gym, because they offered towels and a hair dryer, in which, would cost a separate charge. I was told that I had to double the price of my membership, or pay an additional fee with each visit, and pay an upgrade fee of $130. I believe that these are sales tactics to gain more premiums from people. This location is 5 minutes from my home, but I'm forced to drive 30 minutes to another location. There isn't a number to call, as each location seems to govern itself."
1156,565684,2012-02-26,1,"Apparently, LA Fitness acquired Ballytotalfitness. I was not sent any communication to this effect and therefore do not posses the infamous key code that I need in order to log into lafitness.com. My credit card was charged for an annual membership without my authorization. Being with Bally's for 12 years, this never happened. There is no way to reach LAFitness to get this refunded. I therefore initiated the process through my credit card company. There needs to be a class action lawsuit, as I just found out that the credit company has numerous cases identical to mine."
1157,565609,2012-02-25,1,"I was considering trying LA Fitness again as the recently added Uptown Minneapolis location is very convenient to my home and I was hoping I would have a better user experience than previously. I found and printed a 3 day pass from their website planning to see how I liked the Uptown club, particularly the cycling equipment and the quality of group classes to help me make a decision. When I presented the pass to the member services rep, Mike, I did mention I had been a member 2-3 years ago before this facility had opened. When he asked why I left, I told him I wasn't happy with the St. Louis Park cycling equipment. There were always 5 or more inoperable bikes which meant getting a bike meant showing up 45 minutes early. Club staff kept promising the bikes would be fixed or replaced, but nothing happened for months. I also found there were very few group classes and poorly trained teachers for the ones offered. The 3-day pass was accepted without a problem. After I finished a cycling class, and returned to pick up my ID, Mike asked me if I intended to become a member that day. When I mentioned I wanted to try a Yoga class using my 3-day pass the next day, he informed me I shouldn't be using a 3-day pass as they are for people who have never been members. (That is not stated anywhere on the pass nor is it stated on your website). I told Mike this and he begin to argue with me. I told him I was not going to argue that I would just skip it. He then lectured me that the club is a private club, that it is not free and that I should sign up today as there is a special offer. I told him I did not want to be pressured, that I intended to make certain I would be happy with the club and that I wasn't concerned about missing out on the special offer as I had an email offer for the same price. This seemed to put Mike right over the edge. He yelled at me that he wasn't pressuring me and told me LA Fitness doesn't need my business. Clearly, if he wasn't going to sign me up right then, he didn't want me as member at all. I guess I must have been messing up his sign-up percentage. Mike was officious, defensive, argumentative, disrespectful and high pressure. Too bad. The facility is near my home and is beautiful. The cycling equipment is great as was the group leader. I conduct customer sales and service workshops for corporations across the country and I recognize organizations who hire, train and incent sales and service staff to treat customers and prospects with respect. This club fails the test. In a city with many, many fitness facilities, service is the only differentiation. I am disappointed with LA Fitness... yet again."
1158,565094,2012-02-24,1,"They got me sign up for personal training as I was signing up for the membership. I made sure that the membership fee was monthly, but never heard of one-year contract for personal training and they never disclosed that information. They just told me about the cost for session and that the payment will be billed along with the membership. So I signed up for it and didn't even have a chance to read the fine print of ""one-year contract"". When I went to cancel the training after unsatisfied and unmotivated sessions, they told me that I am bound to the one-year contract and I cannot cancel. They said the guy who sold me the personal training no longer works there, and the management is pretty much just telling me I have to pay."
1159,564770,2012-02-23,1,"Continuously trying to deceive and extort money from consumers: continues to charge customers after cancellation, makes the cancellation unreasonably difficult--unready system, down phone line, mandatory mailing; failed to provide confirmation of cancellation, forces potential customer to sign a waiver without providing the term that they ask to sign."
1160,564656,2012-02-23,1,"Since your corp. bought Bally in Chicago, we thought that everything would go better. Damn it! But I was so ** wrong. Every little thing that breaks takes at least a month. I said a month to be fixed and that for me is an insult. We talked to the ""manager"". She lies like a damn drug addict teenager. I went to check for another gym because I am old enough to understand that we are not welcome in your ""new corp"". Thanks for nothing. I ** hate the way you damn people treat us."
1161,564493,2012-02-22,1,"I have just been through months of trying to resolve complaints I have with this company. At one point, I actually thought that the end result was going to be a positive resolution. Ha! In the end, they managed to extort money of me as well just to get rid of them. Their gym sucks, the staff are arrogant and rude. The personal trainers are a joke. These people have been trained for one simple purpose: to extort money out of people. Their house of cards will tumble one day - it always happens when you are dishonest!"

1163,563983,2012-02-21,1,"I'm not sure where to start as the whole situation is one big annoying mess. I joined LA Fitness about a year ago and also signed up for personal training sessions. I clearly asked the manager what happens if I get pregnant again and he said I could freeze it or cancel the sessions at any time. I worked out with my trainer for 3 months. I was not overly impressed. He spent more time on his cell phone than actually paying attention to me. In any case, I became pregnant but continued to work out with the trainer. During my second trimester I started to experience a few health concerns, so I froze the training sessions for 3 months. During this 3-month period, I was put on bed rest. As such, I called and froze the training sessions another 3 months, or so I thought I did. The freeze never went through. I spoke to about 8 different people all telling me that I owed them money for the sessions. I explained over and over again that I was pregnant and on bed rest and that I froze the membership. They were completely rude, obnoxious and just plain stupid. I finally spoke to someone who seemed to know what he was doing. He told me my freeze was taken care of. However, a few days ago I noticed a $400 charge on my CC for training sessions. I had to go in person to my local gym where the manager proceeded to tell me that I was creating more work for him and that I did not freeze anything and that I did not speak to 8 different people but rather just two. I spent over an hour at the gym, when I should have been on bed rest, disputing these charges with him. I have never had a more frustrating experience at a gym ever. He agreed to refund me the money charged; however, it has been a few days and I have not seen the credit on my CC. I am in the process of trying to cancel my training sessions, which is apparently another headache. I will never again get personal training sessions from this gym and I am debating whether or not to just cancel my entire membership. They have the most horrible customer service and rude staff members."
1164,563750,2012-02-21,1,"Trying to talk to manager at least 5 times: When I first purchased 2 memberships for my sister and cousin, my sister purchased a parking card. We worked out, and came down to pick it up. It wasn’t ready so I came back 3 hours later, still not ready. I came back another day, no one could find it. Meanwhile, I needed to pay for it again. I came back again. Then my sister said, “Cancel it then.” Finally, I got a call a week later that it was ready. On the card it said no refund. So we talk to their manager Tiffney. She said it was at a one of the gentlemen’s desk all the time. I said, “Why didn’t the person at the desk know where it was?” Meanwhile, we paid for parking. Then I tried to talk to Tiffney 4 other times. She was busy, supposedly. Now I’m unable to cancel the membership for my sister and cousin. Today, they really made me mad. The front desk told her I was waiting. For 30 minutes, I waited. Even one of the young men working with membership told her as well. I saw her looking over at me. Twice, she took calls on the phone. I hope that she will not be manager at their new office. Maybe because we are seniors. At the office in Century City, they are very nice and they never kept us waiting. My sister was a member for at least 30 years. My sister came in to renew, and it was past the renew date. I think Tiffney remembered her. So when I was in Minnesota, I knew she was upset so I purchased a membership for her and my cousin. Now Silver slippers will pay for the membership to 24 Hour Fitness through AARP so she and my cousin will join there with their friends. I come here in the winter, and get away for the winter weather. So I belong to LA Fitness in Minnesota. I needed to cancel the membership by the 23rd. I tried to cancel, and couldn’t online."
1165,563444,2012-02-20,1,"I went to this club today. The pool area including sauna and whirlpool were remained closed and have been for month. Nobody seems to know when it will re-open. The toilets in the men's locker room were overflowing and unusable. There was no soap in the shower dispensers and many of the driers were broken. There were dirty towels in the shower room. Yet, I am charged a $5.00 late fee for not paying my membership dues on time, even though I was never sent a bill!"
1166,562972,2012-02-18,2,"My membership was obtained through my girlfriend's Bally's account. On December 6, 2011, we sent a non renewal notice via certified mail, as per our written agreement. However, the membership was not canceled. Bally sold many clubs to LA Fitness, and one of them was the one we used to go. And even when Bally received our cancellation letter, they failed to either have our account closed or notify LA Fitness of the status of the account. As result, LA Fitness has drawn the fees from our bank account like ignoring our request. We contacted Bally's Office, and they are ""washing their hands"" saying they have nothing to do and we should contact LA Fitness. We exhausted our energy trying to contact LA Fitness. Apparently, it would be easier if we use the resources as members if we logged into their website. But they are taking our money to cover the membership. Neither our account number nor members' card numbers are recognized by their system. We have a copy of the certified letter we sent, and we have proof that the letter was received/delivered on December 12, 2011, at 3:20 PM."

This was done to my son, not once, but twice."
1168,562236,2012-02-16,1,"So I signed for personal training. I agreed on a price per month but was told I can cancel any time. I went in for the next scheduled appointment but apparently I had to sign up online which I was never told. I was thrown into a semi work session with a random trainer. Next appointment set it up online. Trainer canceled on me. Tried again, trainer cancel on me. Canceled the personal training but now I have to ""buy out"" my sessions. It is going to cost over $1000 to cancel a service which I do not want. After I sent in the paperwork to cancel, I was still be charged for the sessions. Left a message with the manager. Then some random person called me and said I owed money. Explained to the girl I wanted to cancel my membership and did it back in November. Then the manager got on the phone, explained that I signed a contract, and my sig was in the paperwork that it was for a year. I explained that the trainer that signed me up said I can cancel anytime.The manager gave me 3 options: I can buy out my sessions for about $1000; I can continue the year out and pay $240.00 a month; or I can buy out my sessions at a later time but will have to pay 50%, which means three months from now I can continue to pay 240.00 a month and then pay another 500.00 to buy out. Well, I guess I made someone some money. I also asked the manager does this happen a lot. He said time to time. Hmmm. Maybe someone should do some better training."
1169,562204,2012-02-16,1,"I don't even know where to start without blowing a fuse in my brain. So I will be very objective and provide the facts. LA Fitness makes it so impossible to cancel, no matter what you do. Here are the typical answers: we didn't get the information, it is not register you cancelled, your account is still open, I am not sure what happened.I heard horror stories so I decided to spend the extra money and certified my mail in March 2011 since this was the second notice. I thought I was safe, I got the return receipt from Irvin, CA (does anybody work there)--sorry I need to stay on course here. Anyway, it is February 2012 and I get a collection notice stating I owe them money. Really because I am no longer a member, I no longer belong to you LA Fitness. I sent the required paperwork certified.Based on these complaints, I decided to call and verified my status. You won't believe it, it was open! Shocker--not! So there was an option if I want to be contacted by an attorney--yes to the 100th power yes.There was an overall experience choice on this blog and I wanted to add, strongly disgusted and dissatisfied.

1170,561022,2012-02-12,2,The gym and spa is dirty and there is hair inside the showers. Nothing is clean. In spa there is water. In the pool the dirt is seen and it’s disgusting. The shower’s handles are not tight and in the showers there are paper and dirt everywhere.
1171,560990,2012-02-12,1,"The gym at the Arlington, VA location is acceptable but the management is horrible. I became a member of at this LA Fitness in January 2012 only for the cycle classes, which are pretty good on average. The management needs to come up with a workable solution for the overcrowded Saturday morning class, but that's another story. The main reason this place is awful is because of their terrible lost and found policy. I inadvertently forgot my wallet in the women's locker room after the Saturday cycle class last week. I accept full responsibility for the idiocy of leaving my wallet. When I came back to pick it up, I was happy to learn that someone had turned it in; however, instead of handing it over to me, I was told that it had been placed into a safe for which only the operations manager has a key, and he, of course, only works during regular business hours, so I would have to wait until Monday morning. First of all, a call giving me a heads up that my wallet had been turned in would have been nice, so I would have had the chance to pick it up before it was thrown into a safe with no key onsite. After explaining to the gentleman at the desk that I now had no way to buy food or gas for the whole weekend (and that I had a few carrots and some eggs in my refrigerator), he reluctantly called the manager, who reaffirmed the policy and refused to come in to open the safe.So, I returned at about 9:15 on Monday morning only to be told that the manager went to the bank but ""should be back in 30 minutes."" I was not happy. Upon his return, I explained to the manager why this is such a terrible policy. He thought I should be grateful that it was returned. I tried to explain that, while I was appreciative of that, it made no sense to hold it hostage for an entire weekend and that they need to have a key onsite. He didn't understand my point and was outright rude, so I cancelled my membership on the spot."

I called them and complained and they said that Bally's sold them my membership. I explained to them that I canceled my membership to Bally's over 6 months ago. They said they had no record of that and I had to go to the location where I belonged. I went there and they said they had no record of my old Bally's account and could not access it. They gave me a number for Bally's to call. They told me that they sold my membership to LA Fitness and no longer had access to my records. So, both companies don't have records of my membership. LA Fitness thinks I owe them money for a gym I have never been to and then tried to sell me a membership when I got there. This is predatory and beyond absurd. Something must be done!"
1173,559682,2012-02-08,1,"While in Florida on business, I workout at La fitness located in Deerfield beach Florida. Today, February 8th 2012, I went to workout and my membership card would not swipe. I asked the person assisting me could she charge my account for a new membership card. I gave her my name and address but she could not locate me. The GM came over and he found me in the system but as a former employee. He told me my membership was cancelled in December 2010. I explained that I'm a paying member and have been for a year. He accused me of lying and requested I give him my credit card. While leaving to go out to my car and bring him the credit card, I said this is some bull**. When I returned, he pointed his figure at me and told me to get out of his gym for cursing. I refused to leave and he called the police and I was escorted out by BSO Police. All because I said this is some bull**. Please note, in passing I have heard this GM curse during his conversations on a couple occasions. What a hypocrite and what a lame for calling the police to escort me out of the gym for cursing. There were no other members present, I was not loud and or disruptive. I simple said in a soft and tone, this is some bullshit. For real La Fitness. This is how you treat a customer who is simple bothered by the fact that your GM accused me of lying . I'm one out of 10 black people that workout in that gym. The lady at the front desk by her own admission recognized me and acknowledged the problem I had with my membership notscanning. I called the Ft lauderdale location to get a number and according to Stephan, Ft lauderdale GM, the deerfield beach GM already called to inform him of the incident and of course Stephan and his staff, Carl, were rude and hung up on me several times. Unbelievable. As an employee, I have witnessed their unprofessional behaviors towards clients. Now as a client, I have experienced their outrages attitudes and immoral behaviors. It's call false power and there are no consequences from Corporate for their bad behaviors and mistreatment of clients."
1174,559525,2012-02-08,1,"My lifetime membership was not transferred over to LA Fitness, because they said my membership was not current with Ballys on December 1. I went into Ballys today, not even knowing it had been bought out and the sign out front still says Bally Total Fitness. I discussed the problem with the manager there, who said, ""Sorry you are no longer a member. You need to talk to Ballys.” I have had my $10 a month automatically deducted from my bank account for 26 years, and Ballys decides to stop taking the payment out of my account, which I had not noticed. Therefore, I was told I was not a current member and could not be transferred over. I think we need to start a class action lawsuit for all of the people they have done this to. It took me over an hour to get through to them on the phone to ask for their help, to which they replied, “Sorry, nothing we can do.” Let me know when and who wants to start this lawsuit.

""Our time is valuable, so let them do this for us! "" I sent the required form on December 2011, 3 months after, they were still charging me for my membership. It was pointless to cancel my debit card and then the miracle occurred! Thank God for the customer service. Jennifer ** solved my problem better than I thought. All she did was simply be a rude person who didn't let me finish my sentence plus she was not able to professionally explain why the problem happened in the first place. To confirm that she does not meet the requirements to be a customer service assistant, she puts me on hold without any notice and transfers me to the supervisor because she couldn't handle the conversation? Anyway, that was exactly what I wanted, my card was cancelled within 2 minutes, plus I was refunded for the last two months. That's what you call fast service, if you know what I mean."
1176,559411,2012-02-07,1,"Last fall, as my graduate class work was eating up more and more of my free time, I went to the LA Fitness in Downingtown, PA to put a freeze on my personal training account. They told me for the privilege of paying them another $15 per month; they would freeze my personal training but keep my gym membership going. This sounded great (with the exception of the $15 fee but hey, it was better than $160 per month) so we arranged it and I went about my business. Life went on and so did my classes. At the end of the semester, based on my slipping GPA, I decided that school had to come first and because my job schedule interfered with my night classes, I gave my notice at work during the holiday break.On the night of Tue., Jan. 10, I went to work out with my friend Stephanie. I checked in at the desk at LA Fitness and explained to the guy running the desk that I could no longer afford the luxury of a personal trainer because I was unemployed and needed to see what could be done to cancel my personal trainer membership. This person told me (and Stephanie can attest to this) that all he would have to do was unfreeze my account in order to submit the cancellation, which he (supposedly) did while we were standing there. Then he handed me a single sheet of paper and told me that all I had to do was sign at the bottom and mail it in to LA Fitness corporate headquarters in Irvine, CA. Happy that everything was working out, we went to the treadmills and had a good workout.Everything was working out? Not really. Little did I know that the Evil Empire of LA Fitness would soon invade my peace-loving world!I mailed the one sheet document on Fri., Jan. 13. As far as I was concerned, I had fulfilled my end of the cancellation process as laid out by the LA Fitness employee. On Tue., Jan. 24, I checked the balance in my bank account and saw that $160 had been withdrawn by LA Fitness precisely the amount of the monthly personal training fee. I called the gym located at 109 Quarry Road, Downingtown, PA 19335 (the very same gym that I attended regularly and had spoken to the front desk attendant about canceling my personal training contract) and was transferred from the assistant manager to the general manager.The general manager identified himself as Brian **. In fact, there is no way to know what his whole name is because even the website identifies him as simply Brian **. This soon became a common theme among LA Fitness employees, as you shall soon see.When I told Brian ** of my situation and requested that the billing snafu be rectified, he proceeded to tell me point blank that he had no idea who told me that it was otherwise, but once you are in a personal training contract with LA Fitness there is no way to get out of it with the sole exception of buying out. The way he explained it to me, buying out entailed paying 50% of what was left on the contract 50% of a service that I would never receive which would come out to $640 for me. I let Brian ** know the description of the person that gave me the cancellation information and he told me that I was wrong because all of his employees know what the process is. I then informed Brian ** that maybe he had a training issue with his employees because it seemed to me that his employee, in fact, did not know what the process was and that one hand didn’t know what the other was doing over there at the Downingtown LA Fitness.Brian** took this opportunity to tell me that he has fantastic training for his employees and seemed surprised when I did not agree with him. To get us out of this conversational rut, I reminded Brian ** that his employee gave me a specific set of instructions to cancel my personal training membership, which I followed explicitly, and when they did not follow through on what I was told was going to happen, I saw that as an egregious error on their behalf and I wanted to know what could be done to fix things. Brian ** once again told me that company policy was that no one gets out of LA Fitness contracts before the end of the term.Admittedly, I was getting pretty heated at this point. First, I asked Brian ** if he could print out a copy of this policy, but then I amended my request to emailing it to me. This made more sense to me because (1) I was too mad to go down there at that moment; I was sure I was going to cause a scene if I did go down there, and (2) LA Fitness emailed me for appointments and specials, so this would be an easy request. Wrong again, stupid little customer! Brian ** cut me off midsentence and told me he had no access to my email address. This didn’t make much sense to me. They obviously had it from previous correspondence, and I reminded him so. To me, this was just another example of Brian’s total commitment to doing absolutely nothing to help me, his customer.At this point, (no kidding) Brian ** took a tone that is most commonly found among tenth grade athletes inviting me to meet them at the bike rack after school for a fight and he said, “So come on down here and I’ll show you this in writing.” Got something to prove, do ya, Brian T? It really came across as challenging and threatening! I responded by telling Brian ** that I did not appreciate his tone and I felt like he was challenging me. I think he must have realized his misstep because he backed off slightly, yet still told me that he couldn’t do anything about my personal training membership but could cancel my gym membership.Really?! Ok, if you are going to suggest it, then yes, please cancel my gym membership. Brian ** canceled it during our conversation. Do you know how I know? I got an immediate email saying that my gym membership had been canceled.So, convinced that Brian’s lack of customer service abilities could not possibly suck any more than what he had already demonstrated, I asked for his manager’s name. Brian ** retorted with a snarky, “I am the manager,” to which I responded, “No, everyone answers to someone. I want to know your boss’s name.” After about five more minutes of refusing to give me any information regarding his boss, Brian ** finally told me that, “Her name is Brooke **, but she travels a lot and I’m not giving you her cell phone number.” Do you mean to tell me that this person who is in charge, supposedly, of several LA Fitness gyms in a market area doesn’t even have a desk phone? Apparently, that is exactly what he was inferring because he never gave me Brooke’s number and finally hung up on me.At this point, I was incensed. Livid. ** off.I did a search on the LA Fitness website to try to find information about the Downingtown gym chain of management and a phone number for the next rung on the ladder (think district manager). Of course, I didn’t find anything. So I conducted a Google search and finally had to settle for the corporate call center number.I called the toll free number and Craig ** answered. I gave Craig ** all of the pertinent information, including the horrendous way I was treated by Brian ** and then I listened as Craig ** toed the company line and told me that there was no way to get out of a personal training contract with LA Fitness without buying out. Seriously?! I told Craig ** that even car loan companies work with people in times of financial change. Home mortgage companies work with people who find themselves in a change of financial circumstances. Do you really expect me to believe that LA ** Fitness couldn’t do the same? We really couldn’t come to some workable solution at all? Apparently that is exactly what he expected me to believe.Now, at this point in my story, the absolute worst thing that could happen to me when caught in this kind of frustrating position happened: the tears of frustration started. It’s not something I can control all of the time and this was one of those unfortunate moments when the tear ducts were activated while I was in a state of complete and utter dissatisfaction. I’ll hand it to Craig **. He hung in there with me while I went on a short diatribe about how my house was being foreclosed on and now I was stuck with this gym membership that I could no longer afford and they had taken $160 out of my account that I was counting on being there when I needed it, as the guy at the front desk had assured me it would. Good ole Craig **, listened like a champ yet kept repeating the same spiel that I had now heard over and over again.Recomposed, I asked Craig ** to give me the number for Brooke ** (Brian’s manager). He refused. Completely appalled that I was getting absolutely nowhere, I asked for the CEO’s name. And ** if Craig C. didn’t snigger at me. This set my frustration/outrage rocket into the stratosphere and I called him on it. He, of course, denied it and told me that all of their conversations were taped and anyone could listen to it and know he didn’t laugh.Kid, don’t tell me about taped conversations. I was an air traffic controller. You don’t know anything about tape transcriptions. And even if there ever were one done, do you honestly think I would trust anything truthful about our conversation to be in there? Your company has lied about everything else. Your company has treated me like a flaming bag of dog crap on your front door. At this point, I insisted on having the CEO’s name (hey, its public information anyway) and he finally responded with Louis Welch and asked if there was anything else he could do for me. I asked for his manager’s name Mike **, who never intervened in this conversation and I asked for Brooke ** to receive my information and contact me regarding this nights events. Craig ** then informed me that he could see in my file a note from Brian ** to Brooke ** about tonight’s calls and I asked him again to indicate in his notes that I wanted to hear from Miss Brooke ** myself.Well, here we are, February 7, 2012, and I have yet to hear from Brooke ** at all. Nice customer service skills, Brooke **! My gym membership has been canceled, which never was my intention until Brian ** acted like such an ** hat to me. LA Fitness could have been collecting $30 from me every month if they just would have treated me like a human being. But now they will never see another cent from me and I have started my social media campaign warning every single person I know not to be caught in the scam that is the Evil Empire of LA Fitness.Do you know what else I came across in my Google search to find contact information for LA Fitness? Hundreds no, thousands of comments from other dissatisfied, disgruntled customers and former customers of LA Fitness. Many have experience similar circumstances as mine and all have experienced horrific customer service. Even their employees have a complaint website! In the first 24 hours after my dispute erupted with LA Fitness, a campaign on Twitter was in full effect regarding a protest on all LA Fitness gyms in the UK. Why? It’s very interesting, actually. After a 7-month pregnant woman whose husband had lost his job asked LA Fitness to terminate their personal training contract, LA Fitness refused, citing they had no such clause in their contracts for changes in life and income circumstances. Only after the story appeared in The Guardian and someone tweeted the link did LA Fitness give in to their PR nightmare and the UK government officials are looking into gym contract practices at other LA Fitness locations (see here: **).If you have an issue with LA Fitness, you can call 949-255-7200 and speak to someone in a call center in Irvine, CA who doesn’t give a crap about you. The number listed for their corporate headquarters is 949-502-2043. If you would like to write to CEO Louis Welch, well, the only address Craig ** would give me (which I am sure goes to some other person who doesn’t give a rat’s ** about you) is LA Fitness, P.O. Box 54170, Irvine, CA 92169. However, the corporate address is listed at 6400 Irvine Blvd, Irvine, CA 92620. The (unverified) contact information that I found for Mr. Welch is 7 Emerald Bay, Laguna Beach, CA 92651-1206. My correspondence will be going directly to him as well as the National Director of Business Development, Scot Mackay, and Christopher Perry of LA Fitness International (among others) until I get a resolution.If no one from LA Fitness seems to think I am worthy of receiving a resolution, well, I suppose it will be time to exercise my media training. If you are thinking about joining an LA Fitness, I urge you to please take a look at some of the comments on these websites prior to signing anything with them. For the reasons listed above and oh so many more, I nominate you, LA Fitness, for the Silver Sucky Award. There is no way that you could possibly suck more hind teat that you already do."

I called them on Friday morning (Today is Tuesday, February 7.), and they said that they would have Mike ** call me back who handled all these problems for the gyms. I was speaking to a Matt who signed us up in the first place. All they cared about was getting the other two friends' account info, and they said they would call me back; they didn't. I called several times to hear they were busy. I called Saturday and was told they were busy, and I left my number and didn't get a return phone call. I called again and again, and I got nothing. I continued to call Monday, and I was told they were busy. In the meantime, I have been charged $248.00 in two months in which I only should have been charged $82.00. All they did was call my two friends to get their banking info but could care less that I'm out money. I called this morning and tried to find a number for someone above them, but nobody there will give me a name or number. I called the Trumbull Ct office and spoke to a Kirk who is a manager. He told me to ""get the money from my two friends"", though that wouldn't stop them from charging my account for the future months!I tried calling a corporate number in California, but all you get is a recording. I'm going to my bank today to file a complaint and not allow them to take anymore. Problem is I want to cancel my membership and need to speak to someone, but nobody will pick up after my complaint. I'm at a loss, and in this economy, I wouldn't want anyone to be fired. But these guys need serious training on how to deal with mistakes they made with the clients."

1180,558973,2012-02-06,2,"I have been a member at Bally Total Fitness in Voorhees, NJ since 2003. I never had any issues until LA Fitness took over. In 2011 I gave birth to my son and after I had him I added childcare to my membership at Bally's. When LA Fitness took over I was informed that memberships are transferable. Recently, I tried to take my son into the daycare to find out that childcare wasn't included. An LA Fitness staff informed me to contact Ballys corporate office in California, which was a waste of time. I spoke to a customer service rep named Jose that was rude, sarcastic, loud, and took my matter in a joking manner. Then he was supposed to transfer me to a supervisor, which somehow the phone got disconnected. Then I called LA Fitness’ customer service for them to tell me that Bally’s are the only ones that are able to help me. I’m so tired of the run around and wish someone will be able to help me. This makes me not want to deal with any company, especially if this is how they treat their paying customers. "
1181,558470,2012-02-04,1,"I signed up in 2011 to work with a Personal Trainer to lose a large amount of weight. I showed up for my first Personal Trainer appointment and LA Fitness did not have me on their schedule. Finally, I was scheduled with an arrogant trainer who laid on the floor next to me, telling me to do sit-ups while he checked out all the hot girls, completely irritated that I was there and messing up his game. There was no training going on, he wanted to get the session done and move on. I met with 2 different trainers after that experiencing similar action by the trainers. Finally I was connected with an amazing trainer who taught me form and was excited about getting me results. This is what was I was paying for! Last night I received a message from the Personal Trainer Manager stating that my next training appointment had been cancelled and that I should give him a call for more information.Come to find out that LA Fitness had informed their employees that it has been determined that it is not worthwhile to spend time on member and client retention. We are only concerned with getting the new person and their money through the door."" My trainer heard about this and decided to leave LA Fitness, which I completely understand and I probably would have done the same thing. Now I am left to work with a bunch of arrogant, self absorbed Personal Trainers because it would cost me $2500 to cancel my membership.It is common sense that the national work out chains are there to make money, this is a business but what kind of idiot releases a statement like this. The experiences I have had with LA Fitness make it clear that this philosophy already exists, but who puts it out there like that.I strongly advise that anyone looking to become a member of LA Fitness do not do it! I am out an amazing trainer and possibly $2500 if I want to break my contract with them."
1182,558276,2012-02-03,1,"I visited LA Fitness outlet in Troy, Mi. Feb 2, 2012. The place was so crowded there was a 15-20 minute wait to get on some equipment. I wasn't about to wait, so I went to the pool instead. There was a small class of women doing water aerobics, and 3 other people swimming. After about 30 minutes of swimming, I noticed the towel I brought into the pool area and hung at the end of the pool had been stolen. Confronting a janitor that had just come through the area, told me he didn't take it. After drying off using paper towels, dressing and going to the front desk, the manager could hardly be bothered. Her cold, curt, textbook, robotic ""I'm sorry"" left an impression I will never forget! No compassion, no interest in helping me at all. It was the look of ""it's only a bath towel"".She seemed and looked very young, probably does not have children. Not that that matters except the ""it's only a bath towel"" impression really ** me off! That towel was an embroidered towel and a father’s day gift from my children that can never be replaced. Her lack of human compassion was about as repugnant as it gets! I can only hope if she ever has children, err, scratch that. Let’s just pray she never does!Shame on you LA Fitness, Troy, MI. Shame on you manager! You are disgusting!"

I just got in the spa for a few minutes, a black guy, with really bad attitude, came to me, and told me to get out from the spa. I was shocked and asked what's wrong, and ""why don't you tell me who you are first"". He showed his impatience on his face, and rudely told me to get out of the spa. I got out, and then he told me he is the general manager in McDonough LA Fitness, and pointed to my short pants, and said that I am wearing underwear to get in the spa, and to just get out of there right away. I was really pissed off by his attitude, and the way he performed. I told him I am wearing an underwear inside, and short pants. He just said that my shorts is underwear, and wanted me get out of here right away. He is humiliating me in front of other members by this funny excuse. I took the picture of my shorts and underwear, then went to the front to find him. He was talking to his assistant at his desk. I stood by his desk without saying anything, because I still tried to respect his work. He ignored my appearance, and kept talking to his people. I was really surprised to know how this people run the store, with such customer service. After a while, he turned to me without calling my name with respect. I told him I would like to have a conversation with him, to confirm how can he just judge my short pants as an underwear. That meant I was wearing two underwears. He was so tough, and even wanted me to answer his question just like that. He is an officer, and I am a criminal. Finally, he passed me on to a lady at the front desk, and turned back to his desk. I realized he is having a bad day, and made my morning bad as well. That's what he was trying to do!"

By the time I called him back that same day, at about 4 pm to cancel my membership, I had not received my receipt yet. So I told him I want to cancel and he's like, ""Why? What's wrong?"" I said I need my money back so I want to cancel. He said, ""Okay, since you paid in cash, it's going to be like two weeks for you to receive a check."" I said okay. So I asked again for my receipt because I had not received it like he said I would. On 1/18/2012, I called again. Reason is I had not received either a receipt or a check. I asked you did cancel my account right. He's like, ""Yes, I did. Your refund is pending so you should get it no later than Thursday or Friday."" I waited. I called back on 1/26/2012 and spoke to another representative. He told me my account was still active. I said, ""No way. I cancelled it the same day I joined."" He said, ""I will have the other representative call you back."" That's when I decided to go in to the club. I was told that I would receive it in three days. I want a receipt. He said, ""I can't print it out. I have to send it via email."" He guaranteed I would receive it via email. Nothing yet. I've been calling and they're avoiding me, that I know.

I was told that they do not issue passes and that the only time I could use the club free was the evening of the tour. I couldn't come that evening so I decided to use the club another day. I called the club before I came and was told to come in. I came to the club and was told by the manager that the charge for that day would be $15.00 to use the club. I said that I would only observe. An LA rep at the front desk told me it would be $15.00 to observe. I left the club and called their corporate office and reported my experience. The corporate rep told me that LA Fitness Plainfield offered me a 3-day pass. This pass was not offered to me. The corporate rep issued me a 3-day pass.

I paid my bill every month, but LA Fitness did not live up to their end of the contract. I feel that they stole money from me. One of the reasons I signed up was due to the free sessions, but I never received all of my sessions. When I said something about this, I got an attitude from the employee. He proceeded to do something in the computer and said it was fixed. It was not fixed. They also had me go through four different trainers because their trainers kept leaving. This proved to be ineffective because just when the trainer finally understood what I needed they left, and I had to start all over again. I was lead to believe I would have one trainer that provided me with an individualized program. This was not the case at all. Every trainer I worked with used the same exercise routine with me that they did with other clients. That is until I would speak up and tell them that they were not helping me. Eventually, they would get better because I was holding them accountable for their job. I should not have had to do this. They have a manager, right? Or a company that oversees them?"

I mentioned the overabundance of people to a person at the main desk and was assured there were too many people because of the beginning of the year rush, and that this would change in a few weeks. It's difficult to find a free locker to use. The clerk recommended taking other peoples' clothes out of the locker and throwing them on the floor, which is not very helpful.

At 8 am, there were about 25 other people standing around outside or waiting in their cars. Mind you, we're north of Chicago and it was about 15 degrees outside. Some trainers and class instructors were also present. We were originally told it would be a short wait, but in the end, I waited until 9:15 am in the cold and finally decided I'd had enough. During the over hour wait, I saw about 30 more people waiting outside, many of them deciding to leave. I couldn't believe a business could be run so incompetently and with such negligence. I believe that somehow LA Fitness needs to take some kind of responsibility for this with some sort of compensation for customers. This is really too much.

The third trainer was so bad that I wanted to cry because he spent each session gossiping like a teenage girl and we ended up doing about 1/5 the amount of exercises because he'd take so long to get from machine to machine and would've rather talked about his kids' diet. It's very easy to sign up but horrific to try and cancel. I can't log into the site to cancel, it won't accept my # and customer service is horrible.

Totally unprofessional and the gym isn't clean, machines are broken most of the time. It's uncomfortably warm and not cleaned (smells).

I asked them to stop my training account due to medical issues and they will not. They only freeze it for 6 months, which costs $15.00 a month fee, and then ask that you pay a $480.00 monthly payment in order to freeze it again for another 6 months. So, I would have to pay $480.00 for a training month that I will not be there using. That is flat out fraud and extortion. The training manager Mike said he would talk to his VP and get back to me.

That was the reason I joined that club. I told the corporate girl at the desk that I was not going to pay the extra money, then she told me she was going to cancel my membership. She started yelling at me, that i could not go into the club, as I was trying to get my kid out of the Kids' Club. She yelled at least 5 times in front of several members, that she was going to cancel my membership. I have never been treated like a bigger piece of ** in my life. I work in the corporate world myself. If I spoke to a customer like that, I would be suspended or fired from my job. LA Fitness does not care about their members.

I visited the gym yesterday evening with my girlfriend. She is very much into fitness and has been considering returning to a gym after being a member of a boot camp program for about a year and a half. I brought her with me so that she could decide if she liked it and wanted to join, and she was planning to use a complimentary one week sports club pass so that we could work out together.When we arrived at the gym with her pass, the frontdesk had us wait almost 45 minutes to see a salesperson. I know it's January -- a very busy time for any club -- so we didn't think too much about it. When we finally spoke to a sales representative named Matthew, he took her information and gave the usual spiel, going overpricing and so forth. He pitched a few higher premium plans and she told him about an email she'd received from LA Fitness offering $0 sign up and $29 per month for a multi-club pass. He told her that he couldn't honor it (even though it was an official LA Fitness promotional email) because supposedly that wasn't a real plan. We then asked for a manager and in response, he started laughing at us and shaking his head rudely. Matthew left and returned and said, ""he said fine, we'll do it this one time, but you have to sign up right now."" We explained that we wanted to use the 7-day pass which we had so that she could see how she felt using a regular gym again first, and then if she liked it, she'd sign up after the seven days.Again, he started laughing at us and rudely stated she couldn't use the pass at all because she had been a member before, even though he couldn't even locate her in the system. We explained that the pass specifically stated that it was to be used by non-members but said nothing about membership almost two years ago being a disqualifying factor. He responded rudely and again, we asked for a member service manager to which he rolled his eyes and walked away. He returned with a sales manager named Karim, who was even more rude than Matthew had been. He walked up briskly and obviously irritated then said very loudly and rudely, ""look, you can't use this pass and that's it.""At this point, other members turned to see what was going on and were watching Karim humiliate us while Matthew laughed alongside him. He continued ranting loudly and rudely about how if she was ever a member in her entire life, she couldn't use it, and that he could kick us out right then and there if he wanted to but he was going to be nice and let us work out just this one time. I then told him that we had called corporate member services beforehand to inquire whether she could use it or not, and they said that as long as she hadn't been a member in the last 6 months, she was encouraged to use it. Then he went so far as to say that we tried to sneak into the gym and that we knew better than to come here with this pass and that he had every right in the world to kick us out.It was ridiculous and extremely embarrassing, to say the least, and here we are in front of several customers being portrayed as sneaks and unethical patrons while getting yelled at by the sales manager. I asked for the number to a regional, district or corporate manager and he said that there was no corporate phone number and no district/regional manager. I asked for his full name and he stated he didn't have a last name with a smile on his face, and we left. Meanwhile, Matthew is still laughing at us in the background.We did not even work out. After wasting almost two hours getting yelled at and scolded and put down in front of our own community members, we left out of sheer frustration and embarrassment. It was quite possibly the worst display of customer service or plain old human decency I'd ever seen. No customer of any organization or establishment appreciates being laughed at, made fun of and treated like a second-class citizen.I called the corporate member services line again this morning and spoke to another representative who reemphasized that it was a six-month period between guest passes. The employees at this gym are a total joke. I'm canceling my membership and spreading the word about them to everyone I know, including my employer (who participates in a group agreement with them) and co-workers. I will discourage everyone and anyone from signing up with them as far as my power will allow. It's a good thing that I'm a journalist. These employees are a disgrace."

1204,550863,2012-01-11,1,"We need a class lawsuit! Like so many others below me, LA fitness has purchased the Bally’s club nearest my home. I was just told by Bally’s corporate that as of December 16, 2011 LA Fitness will no longer accept Bally’s members. I also have a membership where I was able to use any club nationwide. I no longer live near the club that wrote the original contract. That club is still Bally’s; therefore, my membership was not transferred to LA Fitness, and according to Bally’s that is the reason that I was not notified of the partial buy-out. Bally’s should have notified everyone who has the Premier Plus membership since we have the option to use any club nationwide. I am paid through November 2012 and the nearest club to me is now 45 minutes. We need a lawyer who can get a list of everyone with a Premier Plus membership. This is impacting many people. Bally’s needs to convert those who want to be converted to LA Fitness."
1205,550760,2012-01-11,3,"On 1/2/12, after LA fitness acquired Bally's, I purchased a Bally's Lifetime Family membership from a woman who bought it in the 1980's. She & her husband both used it. Her contract specified it could be sold once, with no transfer fee. At the Federal Way LA Fitness, we were charged $100 transfer fee in spite of the contract language. Okay, we accepted that. Then I specifically asked the membership director if the original membership was a family one, would it now be a family membership for me. Naturally, she said, ""Yes."" Well, now at my club, they are telling me that it does not show as a family membership. The other aspects (dues & nationwide access) are correct. I called the Fed. Way membership director on 1/10/12. She denied saying, ""Yes"" about the family membership and said if she did, it was a mistake, since only one name was on their computer record. Well, the original buyer had no kids at home & is now divorced, so I guess it would have only her name. That would not change the fact that it was a family membership. There apparently was some glitch when the computer records changed from Bally's computers over to LA Fitness computers. LA Fitness refuses to take responsibility for it & refuses to abide by their agreement to honor the Bally's contracts."

She apologized but did not take down any of my information or offer to investigate the matter further. It really surprises me that basic safety precautions were not met. How can I, as a paying member, feel comfortable knowing that staff members are giving out personal information to stranger, basically? My ex is not listed on my membership information anywhere. I am not married and I know he was not asked for identification because he had been using his twin brother's cell phone number to attend because his membership has been revoked and he does not have ID because of a legal matter. The staff member had no way of knowing if he was stalking me or what his intentions are towards me so why would the staff member give out any information about me in the first place? Because I have not had any contact with him since then and nothing has happened to me yet, I don't even know if I should have called the police or not. It really irritates me that I pay to go to any LA Fitness in Florida and the one that is closest to me currently I can't use because I am fearful that he will show up there, since he is very familiar with the location. So I have to go clear across town just to work out and to do so cost me extra in gas and toll fees. How is this fair? If only the staff member just would have said sorry sir I am not able to give out any member information."

On Saturday night, 1-8-12, I got out of the hot tub at 7:50 p.m. I forgot that the club closes at 8:00 p.m. but I hurried up and went to get dressed. Jason stood at the exit of the women's door at 8:02 and yelled closed! I said to him please give me 5 more minutes to finish getting dressed. 3 minutes later, he yelled again closed! I barely could finish dressing. He waited for me at the women's exit then fussed at me! He said, “We close at 8:00 p.m.” He walked me out of the club still fussing at me. I said, “Jason, I am sorry. I tried to hurry and dress.” Still he was fussing at me. I do not like this kind of treatment. I am going to write the BBB about this. "

I called the LA Fitness local customer service number, the LA Fitness corporate member services number and the Bally's reimbursement department number and no one can explain why I am being charged more. Aside from being thoroughly annoyed about the incorrect payment, the customer service representative was the rudest person I have ever spoken to over the phone. He did not want to give me his name initially but I informed him that I needed to know to whom I was speaking. Then when I told him that I would like to speak to his supervisor he initially refused to give me his name or contact information. Eventually, he told me his supervisor's name (Todd), but he was most likely lying. I am about to send an email and letter to their corporate office because the treatment I received was deplorable.

1210,550191,2012-01-09,1,"It was mid December when I found out LA Fitness was taking over Bally Total fitness I had heard they closed other locations, but I was okay with that, because I was left with the distinct impression that the current location would still be in operation, because when I was asked to sign to get my new LA Fitness card, then today, when I went in to workout, I was told the location will be closing, which would be okay, if not for the fact that the nearest LA Fitness location was at least 5 miles away. In a nutshell, my issue is LA Fitness failed to disclose contract details and changes (my initial contract was for a single location) in the said contract, before getting signature, and their intent to close a location. I now have to go through the mess of trying to cancel my membership, and monitoring my accounts, ensuring they do not continue to withdraw monthly dues, so to not mess with my credit now. They should have informed me ahead of time that they were going to close the location, before I signed up."

When I was reporting it to the management, there were at least 2 other members in line to report the same thing. All of us have similar stories. Our lock was not cut open or anything but somehow in a span of about an hour, the thief or thieves were able to open our lock, go through our bags and stole the items. What was infuriating was that the management was so nonchalant about the theft. All they ask for was our name and membership number and then they gave us a customer service number to call. They do not even want to take down the item that was stolen. I have to tell them to write everything down. I also ask if they are going to report this to the police and they said that they will report it to their head office or something. The sad part is this happened to me 3 months ago last October. I'm sure this is a recurring event yet they did nothing improve member security. I filed the police report myself."
1213,549873,2012-01-08,1,"When I first signed up for a year's membership here, I was told that I would be charged $400.00 for a full year, and that by paying this year in full, I would have the benefit of renewing my membership month to month for $20.00 each month thereafter, forever or until I cancelled (that was on 1/18/11). Okay, so now my year's over, I've been getting calls on my cell phone everyday for the past week from 2-3 different sales representatives, telling me that my gym membership would cost only $155.94 to renew for a full year, if I renew it by my expiration date, which is coming up on the 18th. Today (1/7/12) I decided to drop by and ask what my options were. Jessica, a sales rep pulls my account up and asks me, "" well, before you renew your account, what about your other family members, Robert ** and Anthony **?"" My response was, ""who?"" So Then we figure out that there are 2 complete strangers added to my account as family members, who have absolute access to all my personal information, not to mention they're added as family. They're from San Pedro which is over 100 miles away, and apparently, they were added by the general manager, according to the employee! Are you freaking kidding me?! Okay, so then I asked her to print out the information for me, and she said she can't and that she would get into trouble. This is fraud and violation of privacy of personal information! Then she goes on to tell me that it doesn't affect me, and that it's okay for them to be on my account. That the GM probably just gave them a discount, by adding them to my account without my knowledge or my permission. She goes on to tell me that there is no such thing as me renewing my account for $155.94. That I would have to pay a full $400 again, including initiation fees, and all that. Whoever left me messages was lying. She then persuades me by saying that I really have no option, but that she can give me a deal by waving a $25 initiation fee and have me pay $30.00 month to month, and that it's a great deal. I gave her my debit card and she makes me sign the debit transaction, without realizing that she didn't even give me my contract to read yet! I signed to authorize a payment, but not a contract. She gives me the contract after 15 minutes, and that was the end of it. She tells me not to give her name, if I decide to report the whole family add on thing, because she'll get in trouble. Well now I'm home and I'm logged into my online account at LA Fitness and it specifically says on my billing information, that I can renew for $155.94! She lied to me!

I understand that under the health and safety act, that the pool temperature should be at least 82 degrees. Why does a new facility have such trouble maintaining this temperature?

My sister bought the membership as a transfer from a friend, and she's never even set foot at the Denver location. Her home club is in Morton Grove, IL. I have been inquiring on this situation and was told that LA Fitness was honoring these contracts up until 12/20/11, but they have stopped doing so. If we had been informed of this, we would have contacted them prior to 12/20, but there was no communication whatsoever, so how were we supposed to know about it? At any rate, we have been told that the only way to stay with LA Fitness is to purchase a brand new membership. Is this right? If anyone has more info about this takeover, please advise. Hopefully we can all get together with a class action suit."

The money cleared my bank account on 12/2, but LA fitness is saying they never got the money, so I need to call Bally. I called Bally, and they will not talk to me because they are saying they no longer own my membership, so LA fitness must handle it. I have been in this vicious circle with no assistance since 12/2, and also my $500, and I don't have a current membership, so I can not work out! LA fitness has the worst customer service I have ever seen, and I am not surprised that so many people are submitting complaints against them. I can not get my money back from my bank, because the funds were transferred electronically. I'm furious because I worked hard for my money. I'm going to file a lawsuit against them, if I have to go another week without getting this issue resolved, especially since I have proved to LA fitness that the payment was made by providing them with a copy of my bank statement."

They were so desperate to get my money and commitment they knocked off $50 from what I paid last year. I agreed to extend my ""National"" membership since I often travel. I then get the news that LA Fitness has bought Bally's assets, and that I am now limited to only using standard LA Fitness Clubs in MD and that I would have to pay much more if I wanted a national access membership, and much more if I wanted access to their ultra-exclusive ""signature"" clubs. This is clearly a contractual violation. I would be up for participating in any C.A.S. if or when one is put together."

After arriving there, I was told that LA Fitness didn't agree to honor the Platinum Lifetime national plan members. I have been living primarily in the Atlanta, GA area and have been using the clubs here with no problem until now. After calling and speaking to the customer service supervisor at the call center that wasn't able to do anything for me, I asked for a refund of the lifetime fee since there aren't any Bally clubs in my area in fact there are no clubs remaining in the state of GA. He told me he could transfer my membership information to LA Fitness, however I was told by Aylin ** that they aren't accepting any transfer members at this time.I have been a dedicated member of Bally for many years, paid for a lifetime membership to be used nationwide. I have never missed a monthly payment, and now can't use the clubs in my the State that I reside because of a deal that was fostered without taking in consideration of lifetime members like me. What I would accept and think is reasonable is the transfer of my membership with all of the benefits to the LA Fitness Clubs."
1219,548755,2012-01-04,5,"I find this crazy that former Bally's members are complaining about having to possibly upgrade their yearly fee of 25 dollars to use an LA Fitness. It's great that you put 2000 dollars down 30 years ago and have a renewal fee of only 25 dollars. Think about it, you have barely paid anything throughout the years. it evens out. La Fitness is obviously a nicer, cleaner, more elite club. That is why their members pay more. You get what you pay for. Ever since LA bought Bally's out, the gym does seem to not look as nice, due to the fellow new Bally's members. They kept their gyms looking nasty and now they are ruining LA.

I then moved to MD where I have been using their Rockville Club for over 20 years. Bally has my billing address as listed in MD, and I swipe in each time I use that club. Now, LA Fitness has purchased all the Bally Clubs in MD and they tell me that they can't transfer my membership to LA Fitness because Bally still had my ""home gym"" listed in NY, and not in MD, where I have been going for over 20 years! I pointed out that they have my billing address in MD and that they can check their systems to see that I have not been to NY gym since 1988.Bally said it is LA Fitness fault for not accepting transfers anymore and LA Fitness says it's Bally's fault for having me listed in the wrong club. Did I mention I have a Lifetime and National Membership?!I will not be able to continue going to the Bally gym that was bought by LA Fitness unless I resign a much more expensive contract with LA Fitness, even though I still have my membership with Bally!

1222,547898,2011-12-31,1,"I just want to share our recent experience with LA Fitness. We are senior citizens, Bally's members for many years and we paid our dues annually. I only attend one yoga class twice a month and my husband attends yoga and Pilates classes once each week. We do not use any other facilities of the club and our membership at Bally's was for a senior membership with maximum use of two days a week. On December 12, 2011, I went to Wilsonville Bally's and when I handed my membership card to the person at the front desk, I was informed my card had to be exchanged for a LA Fitness card. Then I was told to sign the electronic signature pad but to just ignore the scrambled data on the screen as it is just data regarding LA Fitness liability release which I had to sign before I can attend my yoga class. I was told I would then get a copy of what I signed and my new membership card. I collected the new membership card and was handed multiple pages which showed my signature above the line for members buyers signature. I read this contract before my yoga class and I realized I had been tricked into signing a new contract. I went back to the front desk and objected to this deception and was told LA fitness does not have contracts and the papers mean nothing. I pointed out that we had senior memberships with Bally's that allowed us to use the club only two times a week for $90 each paid annually in February for total of $180 and this new contract said we were paid until February 2012 and the rate for 2012 was now $150 each for a renewal of $300 a year. I talked to the manager who said she would check with her manager and get back to me. When she called back, she said they could do nothing at this level and I had to call LA Fitness corporate office to get a senior rate. I called them and they said I had to get Bally's to send the correct amount we paid each year to Bally's and have them send it to LA Fitness before they could honor our current rate. I called Bally's corporate and they said they sold the club and all membership information was transferred to LA Fitness and they now had no records of our accounts. I called back to my Wilsonville club and told them what transpired and they gave me another phone number to call at the LA Fitness supervisor level. That call had me talking to a woman who said La Fitness does not have senior rates and the rate that were transferred from Bally's when they bought our membership were $150 each per year. I said I had receipts showing that we paid only $90 each per year for the last three years but she did not care what I had. She also said how could they know how many times we attended because they do not keep those records. I have since noticed that the contract I was tricked into signing has a Limited Club Access membership type with restricted dates and times. If that is available, they must have a way of knowing when you are there for the restricted times. I think LA Fitness is just playing hard ball with Bally's members and trying to trick us into paying higher fees. I think seniors and consumers should be made aware of this deception. I do not plan on renewing our memberships when they expire because I do not trust a company that lies to its customers. Since I only go to one yoga class with two different instructors who teach every other Wednesday, I have no way of knowing if they will even keep the instructor I like and I would be paying $150 for the next year membership for nothing. I am reporting this to the District Attorneys office since the signing of a contract without being given a copy first is against the law. If you have the same problems, report it to your Better Business Bureau or your District Attorney's office. If enough of us complain, they will make them comply or fine them for their fraudulent actions."
1223,547723,2011-12-30,1,"I once was a lifetime member of Bally's, until I found out that the company changed over to LA Fitness. I cancelled my membership because of the rude service I received with the operational manager, Rachel ** at the St. Clair Shores location in Michigan. She was rude, and did not want to supply me with the information I asked for, such as her last name. I find this tactic of sales to be inappropriate, because they have your entire name, plus information to your bank account. Not only do they have your information, when asked for a corporate number to speak to someone about an issue, they send you to another facility in another state. The reason for the call was to find out why my account was charged a large amount of money. I came to find out that the company charged me funds for people who I referred, that may want to consider services with Bally, to be told later that I could not be refunded my money, because it was pending, but the money was taken out of my account. I find pending hard to believe. Is LA Fitness trying to find a way to make money, by treating Bally's customers this way. If this is not resolved in a reasonable time, I will contact my attorney, because I still have my existing contract with Bally, which was a lifetime membership. Not only do I feel the need to be refunded, I feel like the company owes me a refund on my lifetime membership."

I was told to get promissory note signed that I would not steal the basketball, no forms could be found so 5 minutes later he approached me to rescind my membership telling me I was not getting a ball & then had the Wayne police come into the gym to escort me from the premises. Really? Was this because I’m an African American male? Luckily, friends present witnessed everything. I had no altercations, no comments, nothing to say to this ""egotistical clerk"" that would cause him to rescind membership & the nerve to have me escorted by Police from the premises. The GM on site also had a rude, obnoxious attitude when I asked for their names. 3 times he refused to provide their names. After I contacted the CEO & Regional VP offices, the GM in Wayne, NJ called to advise my membership money would be reimbursed in full (I await this refund). Only this time his tone of voice & high pedestal was lost (after he alleged spoke to the Regional VP), yet the pompous attitude was present while I was on the premises. Was I escorted off the premises because I was an African American male or was the bug up the clerk's ** too big to fit?"

Today, I am told that my membership would be honored but unless I could find my original contract stating that Kids Club was part of my membership. I now have to pay 10 dollars a month per child in order to have use of the Kids Club in addition to my yearly dues. I am dismayed and irritated by this. I paid this membership in full with the agreement that I would have the babysitting privies, and now I do not without paying extra. This does not seem right. I sure hope a class action lawsuit is filed in this monopoly of a company. I may take my business elsewhere."
1226,545890,2011-12-22,1,"Wife and I discussed her receiving personal training, so I called the Westfield club and spoke with Joseph about options and cost. A cost sheet my wife provided me had $320 written next to a circled 8 (sessions) in a 12-month section which led me to believe the cost was $320 for year of 2 lessons per week. I was emphatic with Joseph on validating the total cost of $370 ($320 + $50 signup) for the year of lessons. At that time, I was not told that a contract was to be signed. At her 1st lesson, she was presented a checklist and contract. She allowed herself to be hurried through the signing process without understanding that the total cost was an initial fee of $370 and an additional $320/month for 11 months (total cost of $3,890) and to cancel required 50% payment of outstanding balance. On Dec 16, I was surprised to see a $320 LA Fitness charge. I went into the club and spoke with Joseph who was sorry we didn't understand, but he had a signed contract and I would have to take it up with corporate. I called corporate customer service who was not involved in any prior conversation and was unwilling to cancel contract without the 50% early termination fee paid. Corporate offered to reduce term to 6 months (maintain 50% contract cost), which shows they can make changes, but not to reduce my minimum obligation.To minimize my cost exposure, my only recourse was to pay the 50% fee ($1,600) and terminate all my fitness memberships (approximately $100/month).

But because I did not have my key card, he explained there was a $5 charge for ""lost cards"". I explained that I simply forgot the card at home and would remember it next time. He said his hands were tied and he could not let me in today. I have been going to Bally's for well over a year at this same location and have never run into a situation like this. Bally's employees have always treated myself and workout partners with courtesy. What a shame they are undergoing financial hardships."

The gym does not have enough equipment now that they closed Bally and brought in all the Bally members. I wish the Bally members would stop whining. They are paying way less than the old LA Fitness members and have a nicer gym with newer equipment to workout at with at a bargain basement price. I hope they all quit and find a $9.00 a month gym they can be happy with so all us paying $29.99 a month to LA Fitness can enjoy the gym."

I made a down payment of $499 and a second payment of $557.66 on 11/21/2011 as the contract called for. The contract then called for 2 more monthly payments of $557.66. About a week after making the second payment, I found out that LA Fitness had bought Bally's and were the new owners of my contract. That would have been fine with me, except that a few days later, I was informed that my account was past due. They had no record of the first 2 payments. They also stated they were not going to honor the installment payment method. In order to train with my personal trainer, I would have to pay the entire amount of $2,171.98 (portion of which I have already paid and have receipts for). This is so unacceptable! They are arbitrarily changing the terms of a legal contract! All I want now is to receive my prorated refund for the sessions I paid for but did not receive. I was told by LA Fitness to contact Bally's because the money was paid to them. When I contacted Bally's, they told me to call LA Fitness because they no longer have any of my account information and that LA Fitness had assumed my contract. What a runaround.

Bally refused to talk to me because ""I am no longer a member of Bally.

Bally try to get me to come back for $99/year and I rejected their offers 4 times. I pay more than double this a mount a year to LA fitness in addition to my $250 registration fees. I am vert disappointed with the way LA fitness is handling the acquisition of Bally. Now, Bally members can join LA fitness at their low rates. Some even pay $36 or $48/Year life time membership. Also, all LA fitness club now have been invaded by Bally members at these low fees and there are no equipments to work out, bath rooms are over crowded and stink, and there are not even enough lockers. In some clubs, people have to wait to get on the treadmills. This is unacceptable. Good high paid LA original members will quit this club and LA fitness will be stuck with Bally low paid members.

I lost my no dues increase, nationwide club usage, right to sell membership once. Secondly, LA Fitness had me sign a electronic signature pad to get a new key card, said it was primarily for liability purposes and then assigned it to a membership agreement without ever saying I was signing a membership agreement.

I was told they would not do anything like that, under any circumstances, and that they see I had only a single club membership at Bally (which was National). They state that Bally was a poor corporate business, that failed to keep updated records. I asked the LA Fitness representative to verify my address, phone, and email with what he had on file. It was dead on. All completely up-to-date and accurate. I asked again to simply assign my home club based on my zip-code, but they gave me complete refusal. The only option is that I pay $19.99/mo (+tax), payable at $39.98 (for first/last month dues), or else I must keep my club 40 miles away. On a plus note, he states I can use any Old Bally clubs that were acquired by LA Fitness (affirming my national membership), but alas those clubs were 35, and 50 miles away as well. I will not be allowed to attend any LA Fitness that was not a previous Bally, except the 1 LA Fitness preassigned ""home club"", conveniently located 40 miles away. LA Fitness does not want Bally's members, unless they pay the $19.99 per month fee. If you pay that, then you're fine. You will receive Statewide Access only. National Access is not an option, unless you buy an LA Fitness membership outright. This is a complete corporate scam!

Bally is in turn saying that, LA Fitness is now responsible. Neither company wants to be accountable for providing a refund, as each claims to not have access to the funds paid on 10/31/11. I'm sure other individuals caught in the crossfire of this transition, have fallen victim to not being able to obtain refunds, as well as not having the terms of long standing membership agreements established with Bally, honored by LA Fitness. The two entities do not want to be accountable, for being fair with their consumers. I guess their hoping for folks to grow tired, and basically disappear, while they indulge in the profits yielded from genuine clients, who simply want to be treated justly.Someone needs to be accountable. As reputable fitness/business establishments, please stand up! At this point, I have not received any sound recourse, in having my wife's payment refunded.

I suggested an exercise that I really wanted to do and the trainer responded that he does his own thing and he's not the other trainer. I thought that was very rude.

He claimed to be giving me a deal only paying first and last month payment totaling 50 bucks if I got my own membership and my membership would only be $24.99 a month. I learned that I was signed up for a kid’s membership. He told me to come to this location for a while and not go back to where my boyfriend originally bought his membership because the other salesmen could complain that he ""stole"" his sale.

I asked him to check with his corporate office, but he refused, saying again that they were wrong. Frankly, this implicit notion that company policy should be dictated to corporate by the local club struck me as peculiar.

I was never told of a possible sale of my home club in Long Beach, CA. When Bally finally did notify me of the sale in an email on 30 November 2011, one day before the clubs changed hands, it assured me LA Fitness would assume my membership.LA Fitness states in writing that Bally members ""with an expiration date greater than 12/1/2014 were not acquired, so we don't accept them.""

When Bally's was recently purchased by LA Fitness, they essentially said that they would not honor the terms of the Bally's contract. My renewal rate was under $50.00 annually; my wife's, which I added later, was $193.00 annually. The original club where I enrolled in Eagan was demolished years ago. The Bally's I went to in Bloomington after the one in Eagan was razed, lost its contract, and closed about two years ago. The current club I go to in Richfield, MN is scheduled to be closed in March. When I went to the LA Fitness in Edina, MN, they were very pleasant but would not give me a membership in their club without a new contract, despite the fact that I am in possession of an email issued by Bally's on November 30. It states that LA Fitness ""will take over the clubs it is acquiring and assume your membership agreement effective December 1, 2011"".

I had a premier membership, where I could use any facility, with daycare included. I went to LA Fitness, and they were very uninformed. They had nothing to offer me but aggravation. Two people were ""helping"" me with no answers. They kept asking a manager, who was literally sitting directly behind me. He would not speak to me directly, only to the other workers. They kept misinforming me, until they spoke to him, and then said I could use their clubs for the rest of the month, but then I had to use my home club only if i wanted to retain my membership (Bally). That club has been closed for years, so they want me to use another club that is over 35 miles from my house. They said I could use any former Bally club, however they are closing most of them, and taking the name off, and putting LA Fitness on? When I inquired as to how I was supposed discern one from the other, and the lady actually said ""I don't know"". Great! Thank you! I paid quite a bit of money for my lifetime membership, just to argue with her about whether or not I was a month to month. I mean hello, I pay dues monthly, yes, but I own my membership. The club I visited in an upscale suburb smelled, and was laid out badly. The pool was very small, and faced outside where everyone could watch you. That is very insensitive, and what a blow to people with lifetime memberships. If you want, you can convert to a month to month with LA?

I have seen the new LA Fitness crew come into our gym like a band of invading marauders and literally force our management team out. They (LA Fitness management) corralled us together one day before the change (11/30/11) and blatantly lied to us regarding our job security. I have seen LA Fitness sales personnel rudely force feed memberships and training packages to unsuspecting and trusting members. To all prospective members: please demand and read all ""contracts."" They will tell you it isn't a ""contract"" but it is-- both personal training and membership contracts. Beware. Personal training contracts are renewable month to month, even beyond the original contract length so be aware! Make sure you get a copy of everything that allegedly has your signature on it. There have been allegations where members' signatures appear on documents that they had no idea they were signing. The only reason LA Fitness exists is to make money.

Then, he told another guy to finish with me. I was upset, but I continued with the paperwork. The guy was unable to answer any of my questions because he told me he was only a trainer. I stayed and worked out. And throughout my time there, I observed how my sales guy interacted with his other customer. He got them on the machine he went through and explained the different equipments, so I ask myself why I didn’t receive the same treatment. I watch him do this with several customers.

The fact that they have a sign made up to post tells you it's an on-going practice (no sign was posted on either occasion). Come on LA Fitness, clean up your act! Schedule clean-up after hours like any other respectable business."
1261,67357,2011-12-04,1,"They bought all Arizona Bally gyms, as of December 1, 2011 and said they bought all Bally contracts. I went to LA Fitness December 2, 2011 and was told 'Bally told us your membership expired November 28, 2011', even though on October 28, 2011. I prepaid a year for Bally that would have expired October 298, 2012. They would not allow me to talk to the manager since 'I was not a member of LA Fitness'. I have filed complaints with 5 government agencies, as well as my credit card. Most of the old Bally members have no idea of the hassle and the fraud they are facing from LA Fitness buying out all of the Arizona Bally Total Fitness gyms, effective 12-1-2011."
1262,67156,2011-12-03,1,"Shame on LA Fitness Corporate for their lack of communication on this whole take-over of Bally’s Total Fitness. Employees were given no notice but let go on 12/1/11 with the option of re-applying at LA for openings if available. Employees not only lost their jobs, but their health insurance and friends as well. They were not even given the opportunity to say good bye to long time patrons or co-workers.Members were given no notice of classes and childcare being cancelled and hours being changed. They were given 8 days notice of their clubs being closed and left to find new ones. They have no idea what will happen to their prepaid or monthly memberships or how to cancel.In my opinion, LA have lost many potential clients because of they way they handled this deal when all it would have taken was a bit of communication and caring for many potential new clients. I think this shows just how much LA Fitness Corporate cares about their customers."
1263,65792,2011-11-28,1,"Horrible experience! With the extra cost you think you would be getting a classier place than the usual Bally’s/Planet Fitness, but don’t be fooled! They have unprofessional staff. I signed up with LA Fitness training manager (paid him cash because that is what he told me I could do) for a month of training. He gave me all the training info, book, paper work, etc. He explained it would come with a training program. He then quit after just four sessions. When I contacted the corporate office, Jeff ** basically told me that it’s too bad and he is not responsible for what LA fitness employees do and I should have asked for a receipt. Worst customer service ever! Do not work out at this place. I lost $400."
1264,64822,2011-11-23,1,"I decided to look into joining LA Fitness. I signed in, received a guest pass and I was called for an appointment. I was scheduled to be given a tour and information. The tour was to be on Tuesday at 5:30. They even called to verify around 1 on that day. I got to the gym a few minutes before 5:30 and was told that the person I was to meet with was busy. I sat there for 20 minutes. Then, I went and asked again stating that I did make an appointment. I was informed that, ""Well, she was with other people. You can have a seat."" I waited for another 20 minutes and went back to the front desk. I was greeted with, ""Oh, yeah. You are still waiting. She's probably still busy."" I gave back the guest pass and walked out. It was rude and inconsiderate. I would never recommend this gym to anyone."

1267,63050,2011-11-15,1,"I have been charged a year for not using LA Fitness. I mailed them a letter to cancel my membership in Dec 2010. They said they didn't receive it. If you want to cancel; 1. through certified mail and 2. call the to confirm after 3-4days through 612-392-0395. I sent them a certified mail, yet they didn't cancel until I called and started fighting with them. They promised to call me back that day. I asked if the call back will take a year to happen. Miguel said no. I have waited 4 days, and received no call, so I called them again. They said they will refund only 2 months worth of payment, not a year, because they didn't receive my first letter. Also in 2010, I told an LA Fitness employee that i will no longer use the gym because I'm leaving the country for 6-12 months. He said no problem, just send letter, and go. Not true. I don't want to give any stars, but they do not let you post, so I had to rate them 1 star."
1268,62293,2011-11-12,1,"The staff just doesn't care. They frequently don't open on time. People stand outside like dummies for 15, 30, 45 minutes, wondering if someone's going to show. Ask to change the TV stations viewing, and you'd think that you need an aerospace engineering degree to do it--""Oh, gee, I can't"". Rather than replace the TVs with new flat screens, they get only 2 flat screen TVs that just run advertisements all day. Rather than replace the carpeted floor in the locker area with tile (like all the new LA Fitness facilities), which is causing the locker room to smell like, well, a locker room, they put down new carpet and a sign telling people to dry off in the shower so the carpet doesn't get wet. Half the locker doors are falling off. All the while, the front desk people just text all day long. They like to come off like an upscale, elite gym, but they don't run it that way."
1269,61726,2011-11-10,2,"I signed up a year ago for membership at their signature club. The promised benefits of membership at a ""signature"" location are: towel service, juice bar, premium amenities, including digital locks on the lockers, eliminating the need for padlocks. The towel service has gone from bad to worse since I signed up. They must have recently laid-off the employees who launder, fold, and stack the towels, because now they have the receptionist doing it. This happens at most once a night and the fresh towels disappear as soon as they're laid out. As a result, there are very rarely towels available at all anymore.The juice bar is not like it's free. In fact, it's quite expensive and it's not really a benefit of paying more for a signature membership. The lockers, apparently, almost never charge the internal batteries in the locks so often, even though there are many empty lockers, they can' be locked. Break-ins are frequent. This week they've posted notices to members warning them that there have been a recent rash of break-ins and suggesting that we leave all valuables at home. Additionally, when someone forgets which locker was theirs, an employee comes in and opens all the lockers until the locker belonging to the forgetful member is located. They leave these lockers unlocked, with all the other members' belongings free for the taking. It's totally unacceptable.I'll be putting my membership on hold for a couple of months while I try other nearby gyms and to send LA Fitness Ballard a message. Of course, I doubt anything at all will change; they obviously care more about their bottom line than providing any of the services they claim to provide."
1270,28058,2011-11-07,1,"Yes, it's been over a year since they said they were going to repair the basketball floor. There are small gaps in the court. It's also very dusty, in which you can see the build up. Numerous players have torn ACL injuries, and sprains, based on the condition of the court. They keep telling us they'll look into fixing it, yet they haven't nor do they provide an attendant in the gym. At times, there maybe be 25 members waiting to play, and no staff, no incident/accident forms ever given to players or their staff to fill out. It is very unprofessionally run. The YMCA is better organized and maintained. Your male staff also refers to black members not by their names, instead it's ""hey bro"". Very unprofessional. Have the floor repaired, otherwise, more people will get hurt."
1271,27263,2011-11-04,1,L A Fitness is settling two of five class action lawsuits pending against it. This does not include all of the smaller lawsuits in local courts. Most recent settlements include Williams v. LA Fitness and Mau v. LA Fitness. You must be part of the class against them to qualify. Any former employees may wish to consider a class action as well. This company will file for bankruptcy soon with all the lawsuits now. It is defrauding multiple people daily. It's disgusting when employees steal from their own members and staff. Managers steal commissions and break open lockers and steal belongings.
1272,26663,2011-11-01,1,"I was sold a membership that was to allow me and my two children to be members of LA Fitness as a family plan, only to find out that it is a membership for one with guest privileges for two. My teenage children need to go to the gym with their Mommy or they are not allowed in. Needless to say, they are not happy, and the membership was misrepresented. Corporate offices could only offer for an additional fee they could give them each there membership. When I tried to explain that I should not have to pay more for what I was told I already paid for they told me how many happy customers they had. Me being a misled customer was not their concern, nor was it a concern that a membership salesperson was misrepresenting LA Fitness and their memberships that they sold. Wish I knew what I could do next."
1273,26322,2011-10-31,1,"My teenage son, who had been a member of LA Fitness for almost two years before he joined the Marines, came home for a week of leave and they told him to buy the weekly membership. He called to cancel before he had to return to military duty, and LA Fitness refused to do this over the phone or online. They refused to do it via fax either.So I'm sending in the cancellation form by mail but my son will still get charged for the additional time. They have a high-tech website and clearly their complicated cancellation policy is merely a way to prolong memberships needlessly."
1274,26318,2011-10-31,1,"I have cancelled my account at least 6 months ago and I am still continuously getting billed for me and my fiancé. I have sent in at least 3 cancellation forms and I am so fed up with them taking money out of my bank account for payments that shouldn't be processed.

They claim that they did not get the cancellation form and have continued to charge me. It is interesting that it is very easy to sign up on line, but you can't cancel that way. You have to go through a real tap dance, and there is no one you can talk to. If you try to talk to someone, you only get a low level greeter at one of their clubs. There's no way to talk to anyone with authority."
1276,23387,2011-10-18,1,"I moved and had to cancel my account which was not under contract. I joined on the $10- per-week deal, and as always with LA Fitness, you cannot simply cancel by phone or in person; you must mail in a request to cancel. I did this and was charged for one week when they cancelled my membership. And then I continue, to this very day, being billed, and you cannot speak to anyone about it. And they do not respond to emails."
1277,21859,2011-10-17,1,"The gym is good and equipment is excellent. But the cleanliness is poor. Since I joined the club, changing and shower areas have become a big concern. The smell, as soon as I walk in the change area, is a moldy, stinky smell. I have troubles with sinus infections and I do not need this. I also see mold in showers. When I come home, I spray my gym bag and other items with Lysol to remove the smell. This last time, the trash can was overflowing."

They stole a briefcase with checks, keys, important documents, etc. When I approached the front desk they told me the building has no video camera installed because they don't want to spend money. The police told me this happens a lot at this location. By the way this happened around 1:30pm."
1279,20626,2011-10-12,2,"I have been going to LA fitness for almost four years now. I go four days a week (work out then basketball for cardio). Recently, they have begun playing volleyball and shutting down basketball 3 days of the week. So now, I am forced to go without one of the main reasons I pay a membership to that gym. I spoke to someone about it and was told they weren't doing anything about it. And I should try going to another LA fitness down the road. This would turn my drive from 5 minutes to over 20. If something doesn't give, either the price of my membership or the number of days volleyball is played, I will surely be canceling my membership. This along with the other 20 or so people who walked in to play last night and were turned away."
1280,20577,2011-10-12,1,"Ten days after I paid my initial payment to join which is one hundred a sixty dollars, I wanted to cancel. But the corporate office in CA would not allow me to cancel my membership, using the Florida 3-day rule of refund as their excuse to not refund my money. I thought that was very desperate on their part not to refund my money or even give me a partial refund. Wow! They suck! I never used anything there, and I lost my money, all of my money!"
1281,20162,2011-10-11,1,"I signed up for personal training. The first personal trainer left and I was reassigned to a new trainer named John, a former marine according to the general manager. I don't believe them. This place has had several managers in the past several months. The trainer acts ticked off every time I workout with him. Lately, I have noticed that he is more interested in the attractive, slim women. They discuss him in the locker room consensus that he's very creepy. He makes degrading remarks about the management staff and mocks the effort of his clients. I decided that I wasn't going to use him as a trainer any longer, so I started going to another location and found an excellent trainer --Tim is great! My advice is if your trainer is a jerk, search for another one. You will find someone better."
1282,19607,2011-10-09,1,"I usually go to LA Fitness Club, Bellevue in the evening so I could exercise and watch news on TV. There are 3 channels. Still, it is hard to get my wish as the management ignores my request, often saying they cannot as they do not have the keys or they are too busy, etc. If I persist with my request, I am told if I ""obstruct"" them from doing their job, they will call the police! I am sure Louis Welch will find this interesting as it impacts on their stocks sold on Wall Street. If one cannot watch Monday Night Football, NFL, College Football, or MLB or news at a physical fitness club, but instead gets forced to watch soap opera on TBS, Bravo etc., then why do they charge high-end fees. This evening I wanted update on Occupy Wall Street protests locally as seen on TV, but was denied. There were some 12 members present but none was watching what was on the TV- soap opera, movies, crime stories, etc."
1283,19303,2011-10-07,1,Sauna in Arcadia Gym does not have proper heat temperature for two months. It's just warm. They said that they fixed the sauna machine but the temperature is still very low. It happened in 2010 and it took them for three or four months to fix it. Some people are dependent on it for medical reasons. We want them to fix it as soon as possible. We are not happy.
1284,18706,2011-10-05,1,"I have a card to gain entrance to health clubs. Lately they are all pointing laser scanner at people's faces/eyes. From what I read, this is not to be done. Are these laser scanners now safe or something? After I complained to manager, they began leaving it on the counter, facing everyone, so their eyes/faces are scanned, too. Bad behavior?"
1285,18547,2011-10-05,1,"I don't know how many years (maybe 12) I've used the gym. For the last 4-5 months of not using the gym, I decided to cancel my membership with LA Fitness. I always heard bad feedback about the gym. And I question why people was so upset for the last year with the gym at London Wall. But now I can say I know why. The manager, Mr. Gary, from London Wall LA Fitness (no surname as he deny to give it to me with an irreverent attitude and impolite manners) couldn't be more unhelpful and arrogant to deny any help in making the cancellation. This is very frustrating when you see everyday their sales people smiling to possible clients and selling how wonderful the facilities and team are. Be careful when you look for your way out. That includes several hours of waiting game over the phone, and a couple of emails and filling forms. Finally, when I felt that I'm getting there, and I would get my membership cancellation, someone from the head office would say very politely: ""Sorry madam, but now you need to pay for an extra month cancellation fee."" That's great!"
1286,17687,2011-10-01,1,"I will never go back to LA fitness, even if it means my life. What I experienced today was pathetic! My brothers and friends invited me, my minister, and his son to play ball on a week free pass only to be discriminated and harassed by a rude sales associate. Little did he know that our church has been looking for a gym for our members to work out together and fellowship with others. LA fitness doesn't care about their customers whatsoever!"
1287,16093,2011-09-26,2,"I, too, was conned into signing up for the Personal Training. I felt like they were pushing it on me, making it sound like something they were doing for me by offering a ""free"" session. Really, it was just to force me into signing up for something I couldn't even afford. The main trainer did my first free session and then afterwards, explained to me the different options of how to sign up for it. I felt duped into, I was basically shocked when anything about pricing came up. I thought, this was a free personal assessment? What it turned out to be was more like ""Hi, we want to pretend to care about you then hit me with, how much can you spend? It's really important because without us, you can't reach your weight loss goals. Look around and see the people here who are overweight still, and it's because they aren't doing the personal training"". I reluctantly agreed to the personal training after he made me a ""deal"". I had my first session on a Friday at 5:00PM with the head trainer. I showed up 5 and ended up waiting an hour before he even got to me because he kept answering phone calls and other people's concerns. Finally at 6PM, he got to me. However, after we started walking towards the equipment. He told me to hold on again because he had to make another phone call. I proceeded to wait another half hour. Finally at 6:30PM, we began our session. During this session, we worked my legs. I then followed him to what I thought was the computer to schedule my next appointment and then he turned to me and said, ""Oh... Uh we're done. Call to make your next appointment"" without barely even making eye contact. After all that, I decided the personal training wasn't for me. I've been wanting to cancel it and was told I needed to do a buyout. Now after approximately 6 months of being a member, I'm relocating to another city that doesn't even have an LA Fitness and still was told I'd need to make a buyout."
1288,16088,2011-09-26,1,"I have recently moved and was looking for a gym in my neighborhood. I noticed that most of the gyms have the same machines and offer a lot of the same classes. So I was looking at trainers and prices. LA Fitness said I had 5 days to cancel for a full refund. I paid LA Fitness, but later, I found a cheaper gym so I asked LA Fitness for my refund. They went from $145.00 a month to $16.00 a month to make me stay. I asked why they didn't offer me that price in the beginning. They had no answers. I asked for my refund after an hour of trying to talk me out of it. I became insistent that they refund my money and I needed to go. This was on a Friday, they told me that the money would be back in my account on Monday. When the money was not in my account, I called the corporate office and they said refunds takes 10 days! I have a hard time believing it takes 10 day to process a refund."
1289,15442,2011-09-23,1,"My fiancee and I are expecting. My fiancee signed up for the personal training a while back, before we were expecting. Our ob/gyn advised against exercising and even was kind enough to write us a note for the purpose of canceling our contract with LA Fitness. LA Fitness continues to not only charge us for a service that we're not using, but continues to alter their story on the policy of cancellations. I feel that in all fairness, they should repay us back for the time of services unused, which at time of writing this is nearly 7 months. Although there is a contract in place, there is no clause that stipulates anything for pregnancy - and it's simply wrong to charge someone for a service they can't or haven't been using. I really hope a lawyer can help us and get our money back from a clearly greedy corporation who is supposed to be ""improving one's health and well-being"" (rolls eyes)."
1290,14235,2011-09-20,1,"LA Fitness La Mirada, your manager on several occasions has been harassing me. Most managers get the manager to back away and change their minds. But your La Mirada Mexican male needs to be dealt with a bit harder. At this point, it's simple verbal assault. When being ignored for his offensive ways, he's still harassing me further. It's way too far for anyone to have gone as a foolish manger. Lately he's slowed down. And every time, he has been halted. But he must be dealt with by corporate. Since I am training for police officer and I am a corporate business owner, these types of matters usually will go to my lawyer group. So, write him up. Get him out of the La Mirada club. Fix your problem person."
1291,13894,2011-09-19,1,"I joined the club in November 2010. I took out a contract for a personal trainer at $40 per month. I paid $380 total and received only 4 training sessions. My partner paid the membership fees and moved to Mexico. So, I was no longer a member of the club. I asked to have the training fee removed, as I was unable to even use the club facilities. My credit card was again charged in September, so I am now disputing the fee through Visa. I called the facility on August 12. I was told that someone would call me back within the hour. I received no call. I went into the club on August 30 and was told that someone would talk to me ""in just a minute"". I waited 30 minutes and nothing happened. I told them I could come in any time the next day to talk and left my phone number. Again, nothing happened. I wrote a detailed letter and hand delivered it to the club. Again, I got no response. I would never recommend anyone to give them a try. "
1292,13094,2011-09-15,1,"My mother had a total knee replacement on April 18, 2011. Through a miscommunication, her membership was never frozen and she was consequently charged for each month following. I spoke with Dre in the Wayne location and he agreed to refund us from April, minus the freezing fee, as we provided a note from her surgeon. The main issue we are having is that my mother supposedly signed up for a 12-month personal training program as well. She has no recollection of signing this contract and when I asked Dre about it, I was told she did in fact sign a contract that, at this point, they have been unable to reproduce. LA Fitness is refusing to refund her for the training sessions that she was physically unable to use during the time of her surgery and recovery. If we have a letter from her surgeon explicitly stating she cannot use the gym under any circumstances and that's viable to use to cancel her regular membership, why can't that letter be used to refund the training? She also has no copy of the said contract for herself. So even if those were the rules, how could we have known that?"
1293,13039,2011-09-15,1,"Weights are never picked up and returned, so I have to go search for them all over the gym. I am a female and have run into several bullies in the gym. Guys that want to take the weights, bench, or equipment that you are using. I have actually been pushed off a bench and had a piece of equipment taken away from me. When complaining at the front desk, they told me they will talk to that guy - I don't know if they ever did. However, recently when this jerk tried to take a piece of equipment from me I said no but he still took it from me anyway. I managed to get it from him, but then he went to the front desk and threatened if I didn't apologize to him he was going to call the cops, and he did! I had 3 witnesses that saw how volatile this jerk was and the staff treated me like a criminal. I called corporate and Rosemary at the front desk, and they basically told me that they told this jerk not to talk to me and they did not cancel his membership. I am tired of being bullied around by jerks in this gym so I cancelled my membership. I feel really uncomfortable working out in a gym where guys can attack you, and harass you at a moment's notice. I go to the gym to work out not to get harassed. Shame on the staff! I am an older woman in her 50s and to get harassed by these young guys is disgusting. You need to do something about it but you won't. Remember that angry guy that came back to the LA Fitness and shot and killed several women because he had issues with women? Well you have been warned about this gym also."
1294,12761,2011-09-14,1,"LA fitness is the worst gym I have ever dealt with. They are corrupt, unethical and hustlers with lies, just for you to buy a contract. Do not go to LA fitness!

1295,12689,2011-09-14,1,"I joined LA Fitness in January 2011. All I wanted was a gym membership but was convinced to get a personal trainer. Before I joined, I was told that I could cancel at anytime and I could do it online at anytime. But that was not the case. I had missed several personal training sessions due to medical reasons and was told by my doctor that I could no longer do the training. So, I advised my trainer and cancelled the membership online. However, they still continue to deduct $446.00 per month until I had to put a stop payment on my account. I feel like I was given the wrong information and I'm still paying the price. I feel like that is bad business."
1296,12537,2011-09-13,1,"I am upset that I have to give a score of 1/5 to describe my experience. They do not even deserve a one, I would put zero if possible! I had so many bad experiences there but continued to go because it was convenient and too expensive to join another gym. It was the absolute worst service I have ever received. They take your picture when you join, so when you sign in, they know it's you. I actually had someone at the front desk laugh in my face at my picture before I lost my weight. I had 2 personal trainers talk about me when I was right next to them, because they thought I couldn't hear them with my headphones in. The trainers are annoying and will interrupt your workout to convince you to sign up for a personal training. It is very harassing and that is just to name a few instances. I could go on. My last straw was when I canceled my membership. The girl I spoke with said I was supposed to cancel within 10 days, but because I did mine in 7-8, it should still be okay and to come back and talk with a manager if they tried to charge me. They charged me for that last month for Sept.10th-Oct.10th when I moved out of state on September 18th and not near an LA Fitness, and where I can have an on-base gym membership for free. Not only did they charge me for a month's service that I cannot use, they already charged me for my last month at signing. So essentially, they are charging me twice for a service I cannot use!"

1298,1397,2011-09-12,1,"I went to LA Fitness to do cardio for 30 minutes and brought a friend with me because he had never been to one of these facilities and wanted to try it out. So when asked the gentlemen and the front desk if my friend can get a pass to try the gym out, he referred me to the sales representative. I never got a name from either of them. First off, I must have interrupted his workout because he walked up looking like I just raped his mother. With a disgusted look on his face, he walked up and didn't say a thing. So I introduced myself, still did not get a response just a mean look. I explained to him about my friend and before I even finished talking, he interrupted me and said ""$15 for him to pass today or you can add him on your account"". With a stunned look on my face, I replied ""well, why do you advertise that you can bring someone with you and give them a 5-day pass to try out the gym?"". With the same disgusted look he replied, ""We are different. We are new"". I had to laugh. So for that I couldn't workout that day. I already have my girlfriend on my account so I'm not going to add another person. Just for that, I am going to cancel my membership which will cancel me and my girlfriend and just go to Planet Fitness where I would rather deal with attitudes for 75% less a month. Good luck."

1300,753,2011-09-08,2,"It's easy to sign up for LA Fitness, but then if you want to cancel, not only can you not just call them up and cancel on the phone, but you have to go down there to pick up a form, then you have to mail the form to their corporate office yourself. Why can't they just cancel you on the computer? The reason is its part of a scam in making it hard for people to cancel to keep your money."
1301,563,2011-09-08,1,"I closed my LA fitness account on July 2011. I went to the center and told them I want to close it. The girl that works at the front desk ask for my membership card and scan it to get my information. Then, she told me that even if I cancel it on that day my membership will still be open until August since it needs 30 days notice. She didn't tell me that I need to send a letter to their cancellation department. So, when I see my bank statement this month September 2011, I realize that they still charge me for this month, but they didn't charge me for August. Well, since August is supposedly to be the last month of my membership and I already paid for it in the beginning when I sign the contract.Then I made a call to the fitness center where I went to open and close my account. The front desk girl give the phone to one of her manager, I supposed.Once the manager answered the phone, he just started to put the blame on me instead of thinking first why a customer doesn't know about it. He started telling me that their workers are well trained, so they will never made that mistake. So basically, it is my fault that is what he is trying to tell me.He seems very annoyed and not interested to talk about the problem. He then told me that if I want some help, then I can come to the center and close my account. But I went there before and it cost 1 month of membership.At the end of the conversation, the manager told me that he is tired of talking to me on the phone and talking about it. He advised that I come to the center and close my account there. I have to say that he sounded like he was angry at me. Well. I'm angry at the club too.LA fitness is the worst club I have ever joined. Their customer service was way below from the worst of the worst. How could a manager of the club be saying that their workers is perfect when they are not. It seems like the manager doesn't want to lose from the customers. The manger has no patience at all.If the manager himself is like that what about the workers? That is a big question mark to the work training."
1302,218242,2011-09-06,1,"When I signed up for a personal training, I specifically asked if I could cancel at anytime since I was unemployed at the time. I was told that I could. When I went to cancel today, I was told that I signed a contract committing me to 48 sessions at $35/session. I could put my account on hold for 6 months for the low price of $90 or I could pay for 24 sessions at $35 to buy out my contract. They kept referring back to the contract. When you ask a question and someone answers, don't trust them. Read the contract and make them wait while you read it before you sign anything. Better yet, don't use them for training at all."
1303,2643,2011-09-04,1,"I have been a member for many years and never bring guests, so two weeks ago, I brought my son and daughter to a yoga class. While they walked in, I waited at the front desk. There, Jonathan ** approached me and asked me to pay a fee for only one of my kids. I gave him $20.00 and he said he had no change. In the meantime, that girl, Krizia, was screaming at me to get the heck out of her gym because I was always complaining; yes, certainly complaining about the gym not having A/C for 10 days in a row and that I was so unhappy on and on. While I was being humiliated in front of members walking in, Jonathan asked me to pay him $30.00 with my check to his personal name, at that point in time, all I wanted to do was to move on and stop the parade they had going on me, so I wrote him the check! That was so wrong on my part. Then, I spoke to the manager who assured me that the check had been destroyed; however, the routing number was used to withdraw $30.00 from my account! From talking to other members, it is the general idea that the people that work there, on the majority, have criminal records. It makes sense that only one crook will ask me to write him a check to his name while the other employee is screaming at me. What a horrible experience, I am in my late forties and those two punks (made bosses) used the front desk to humiliate me in the worst way. After talking to the manager, Mike, he said that they would be internally dealt with. They are both working there, still waiting to see who they can intimidate into a scam! Too bad that a company that deals with customers is so poorly managed that this is allowed to happen and it is permitted to go on. By keeping the aforementioned individuals as staff, they fail to forget that we have choices in a competitive market and that their business is not recruiting but maintaining members as well. I relayed the whole incident to corporate offices and they did nothing about it!"
1304,2579,2011-09-04,1,"LA Fitness is terrible and you should never join. Don't be swayed by its larger facilities. I had left my iPod there and called the day afterwards to see if they had it, and they did, confirming everything down to the name that appeared when they turned it on. They said they would keep it in the safe such that no one would take it and I could come get it anytime.When I went to get it a few days afterwards, they said I had to come between 9-5 (I go after work at around 7) because the person with the key always leaves by 6. I said I can't get off work early like that, and they said I could call to have the person with the key to take it out and have it out for me when i come later on.When i tried to call the next time, the person who answered said that they weren't allowed to check for missing items and that I had to be in person for any checking to occur. She also said that nobody puts things in the safe other than money as that was the policy. Finally, she said he actually looked in the safe early that day for other reasons and didn't see anything in there. I told her what I was told before, and she said she'd talk to someone and call me back. She never didOn another occasion, a few days later, I talked to the GM, Ed, who said that the Operational Manager is the one who handles this and that person would get back to me. He never did. I called again and asked for the OM and was told that there was no OM, that they were trying to hire one, and that I could leave my name and number and someone would get back to me. They never did, and the person who would be supervising was currently at another gym, and I couldn't have her contact number.I called Ed again, and was told he would call back in 10 minutes. He never did, so I called him again. I got him on the phone and then he told me to hold and promptly hung up. When I called back again, he picked up, but then he said he had to call me back because he was with another customers. He never called back. I called several times again, but I went to voice mail. Maybe they can track who is calling and is purposely avoiding me.Overall, I called more than 8 times about this issue over the course of a month and tried to talk to someone in person 3-4 times. In essence, they lost my iPod, and there is no one who would actually talk to me to resolve the issue.They have horrible service. I'm still trying to see if it can be resolved in any way but will definitely be cancelling my account once I get to the bottom of this."
1305,1947,2011-08-31,1,"I had a contract with the personal trainers there. I fell at work and went on workman's compensation. I informed them of my fall and they put my account on hold for 6 months. I was advised to stop working out with a personal trainer because I hurt my back. In the meantime, I was going through a divorce and was forced to resign due to certification issues at my job, and I filed Chapter 7 because I knew I would not be able to afford my bills any longer. LA Fitness was notified by me in May and paper work went out to them, stating that they had until July 5th to dispute for that was the day of the hearing. No one showed. They took out the personal training fee from my account for July. I disputed it through my bank, and LA fitness claims that they did not receive paper work until the 13th of July, when I know they were notified by Federal Court well before July 5th. I spoke with the manager, a female, of the Tucker branch who refused to give me the number to the corporate offices so I could speak to someone, and she kept saying that she was authorized to take calls for corporate. She was very rude and nasty."
1306,218241,2011-08-30,1,I just read all the reviews for LA FITNESS. I am glad I did. My daughter and I were about to joined them. Thank you to all who reported. I won't even consider going with a free pass.
1307,218240,2011-08-26,1,"LA Fitness is a scam! Not only are the employees more concerned about parading themselves around and looking at themselves in the mirror then attending to the customer, but they also hold you hostage when you try to leave their awful gym. I have not attended the gym in over five months and am still being charged for a membership despite the ridiculous letter I sent that they require explaining your reasons for leaving, as if you needed any more. My advise is, do not join LA Fitness. You will regret it."
1308,218239,2011-08-23,1,"I recently had a surgery on my hands and obviously, I cannot workout with heavy weights while I recover. My doctor gave me a note in order that I may cancel my personal training contract with LA Fitness. My doctor stated I could not workout due to ""prolonged recovery from surgeries"". Matt, the manager, told me that the note wasn't sufficient because prolonged was not a definite date. It could mean many things. He stated that I would need another note that stated it would be a ""minimum"" of six months. I went back to my doctor and she gave me another note that stated I could not work out for a minimum of six months. I turned to Matt and he assured me it would be taken care of. The following month, August, my bank statement showed the deducted money from my account. I called LA Fitness and Matt was not there. I called another day and spoke to the Personal Training manager and he said he didn't know what was going on and he would have to speak to Matt, and they would call me later on that day. I never received a phone call. I called again a few days later, finally I was able to speak to Matt. He stated that the corporate did not accept my note because it did not state it was permanent. I told him that I did everything he asked of me to cancel the membership and I needed to cancel my membership. He told me he would give the corporate a call and see what they said and he would return my call. Of course, that has not happened. "
1309,218238,2011-08-23,1,"I had a single club member with a kid club for a $1/month. I wanted a multi-club membership to be able to go to all LA Fitness in the area but didn't want to lose my $1 kid club deal. One day, I called the club in Blaine and asked them if I could just go workout and check out just for a day. They said, oh sure come on and no problem we will get you in. When I went in, Brent (the manager there at that time) manipulated me, made me pay over $90 upfront and canceled my old membership even though I already paid for over a month ahead. He told me my monthly due for my membership as well as my $1 kids club deal stays the same and made me sign up for a new membership. So I paid over $90 upfront and lost $30 I already prepaid and signed up. After I signed up for my multi-club deal, my kid's club deal was canceled along my old membership. Since I already prepaid for both a month and half ahead of time, I didn't find out it was canceled for a month. I called Brent many times, left him several messages and he never returned my calls. I had to go to the gym and speak to him. I saw him twice since then, both times I spoke with him he told me he was working on it. Since then, every time I call, they tell me I have to speak to him and he is the only one who can fix it. This was over a month ago. I left him over 20 messages and he never returned my calls. Finally, they told me he was transferred to the Oakdale location and I should call there and not the one in Blaine. I have tried to get a hold of him there multiple times. They asked for my name and they will come back to tell me he is busy and he will call me back. I have tried to get his manager's number or email and they wouldn't give it to me.About a month ago, they did transfer me to a customer service and I was told they will either speak to him and call me back or they will let him call me back and he never did. I spoke with a manager in Brooklyn Park and he said I have to go back to Blaine and speak to the manager there. Today, I finally got a hold of the manager in Blaine. He acted like he was sad and was going to fix it. At the end, he said well, the $1 is gone and told me clearly Brent should have never promised that and nothing can be done about it. He transferred me to a customer service very much to just complain and move on. When I spoke with customer service, they won't give me his manager's information but they made it clear to me that I can't get that deal, he shouldn't be promised, it is still a good deal to pay $10/month for the day care. I told him that this was not just about money and it is about principle. I used to pay over $50/month at Lifetime Fitness and I was fine with it. But I felt I was deceived and totally betrayed. They lied to me and made me cancel the membership I already prepaid for. They can't fix what their employee broke. They all pick up the phone and say they are managers until they find out you aren't buying a new membership. Once they do, they can't help you. It is extremely frustrating and they were all very unprofessional. I emailed the main email address over 2 weeks ago to either fix that or reimburse me all the extra money I paid to get myself into this mess and no response. I don't want them to do to anyone else what they did to me and I didn't want to move on without doing something about it."
1310,218237,2011-08-16,1,"For approximately six months (or since Pure Fitness was bought out by LA Fitness), the members have been sold a bill of goods. From promises that the air conditioning would be fixed to promises that the mildewed, smelly, worn carpet would be replaced and everything in between. I had been paying for personal training sessions; however, each trainer, one by one, either quit or was fired, making it almost impossible to schedule an appointment with the same trainer more than twice in a row. When it was Pure Fitness, the trainers were plentiful, accommodating and helpful and we were promised LA Fitness would provide more of the same -- it most certainly did not. If a trainer or time slot was unavailable, that was just too bad. I filed a complaint with the BBB, spoke to the corporate office and explained that I continued to pay for personal training but was not able to schedule personal training. After many calls to corporate in California explaining my plight and asking for a refund of my previously paid personal training sessions and a cancellation of my membership, I was advised by Danielle that, although she completely understood my frustration, it was not their policy to do either but she'd see what she could do. After we went round and round, she finally moved a trainer from another facility to the Chandler facility where I had my membership. I was not offered anything else, no free training sessions, nothing. I began training with Ashley and, after a couple of training sessions, she was no longer available on my preferred days. As I was attempting to reschedule, I received a call from Ashley stating that the LA Fitness I belonged to was closing and that I'd have to attend the other Chandler LA Fitness (the one that is packed all the time, even before the other three Pure Fitnesses in the area closed and sent their members there); however, she was still not available during most times that were convenient for me. I, again, called Danielle (and her manager, Shawnee **, who had previously advised me that if I ever needed anything further, I should contact her. I left four messages and never received a return phone call), again, explained my frustration and again asked that I please be refunded the $800 or so I had paid for training that I had been unable to use, and that I be released from my contract that was ending in two months. No dice. I explained that this was a very poor business practice and that although it kept money in the pockets of LA Fitness in order for them to stay afloat, it was creating a very bad name for them as I, and most certainly others, have and will continue to spread the word about their terrible customer service. I finally got a letter from LA Fitness stating that I would not be receiving a refund or my payments, I would not be permitted to cancel my membership and that nothing further would be done to assist me. "
1311,218236,2011-08-12,1,"Basically, I am a very active and sweet girl. I had joined the LA fitness with two of my friends since June 23. At the beginning, I really enjoyed working out there but I felt uncomfortable today when all of the employees mocked me. Today, I went to LA fitness with two of my friends and they decided to freeze the account with paying $10 each month. I suggested them that they would rather to cancel it than freeze it. During my conversation with my friends, all sales representatives were laughing. I tried not to pay attention to what they said, but I knew that they laughed at us. Before I left LA fitness, I went to the restroom. When I came out from the restroom, I did not see my friends around. Then I went to ask the male sales (who was sitting in the first desk on the left side close to the swimming pool) ""Where are they?"". He answered me ""I do not know"". Then I walked in the entrance, he followed me at the back. I asked him again ""are they inside or outside?"". He started to say something that I did not understand and around the front desk, other three females and one male were laughing at me. I said, ""I did not understand what you meant"" but they did not explain it to me in a simple way. At that moment, I felt extremely ashamed and angry. I left LA fitness and tried to look for my friends but they were not in the parking. Then the male sales came out and said, ""they are inside and hope you have a great day"". Then he went out with another male sales.I admit that my English is not good, but does that mean that the sales can laugh at me when I do not understand what they said? They did not show me the patience and friendly look when they talk with me. I am so dissatisfied with their attitude. I so regret that I joined the LA fitness. In the beginning, I told all of my friends that LA fitness is so prefect and there are many facilities. My friends would love to become members. However, I changed my mind now and I will not suggest my friends to go to LA fitness anymore. After I saw my friends, I got mad and explained what happened to them. I talked to them to cancel the membership right away because the staff laughed at me. I think that they did not deal with this situation with me very well. I do not feel happy with that."
1312,218235,2011-08-11,1,"The repair and maintenance and cleanliness are atrocious. Exposed rusty nails in the men's sauna, mildew and mold in whirlpool. Dust on intake and exhaust fans. Treadmills in need of repair, missing equipment. The facility is deplorable."
1313,218234,2011-08-11,1,"Here it is. Shame on LA Fitness. I visited the club in Laguna Niguel while my wife was fatally ill one day to determine if I would consider joining. The salesman said he had to hold my credit card and license for liability purposes. After several strong-arm attempts to sell me a membership, I declined and chose to join 24 Hour Fitness. I recently discovered that I had been charged $49.99 for the past 24 months and spoke to both corporate and the local facility. I went to that facility that one time in my life explaining I did not join nor ever visit their facility again. They offered to refund 12 of the 24 months they charged me, and I asked why not the entire amount ($1199.76). The local manager then told me that he was holding a membership agreement signed by me, which is why they would only refund 12 months and suggested I take that offer and go away. I went to their office, only to find a membership agreement forged (and bear no resemblance to my signature) by their representative who no longer works there. After this discovery, I asked corporate one more time to re-consider a full refund for obvious reasons beyond doubt, or this would be escalated to maximum level of the law and made public by any means possible. The Laguna Niguel sheriff reported the matter. The sheriff spoke to and visited their manager Byron in Laguna Niguel and suggested they refund my money as the police department will pursue this matter as a full crime investigation, including arresting the LA Fitness representative for forgery while addressing the theft and ongoing false charges with LA Fitness. Their decision after speaking with two supervisors was to stand firm and decline me a full refund. Pretty amazing, wouldn't say? In closing, how do they stay in business, and why would they want me to tell hundreds to thousands of people about such a distasteful experience? Doesn't customer satisfaction matter to a company of this size? It does with Mercedes-Benz, my employer. We also strive to earn repeat and referral business. I can only suggest that everyone avoid this organization like the plague after my two days and six hours of time trying to resolve what should have been an open and closed case."
1314,218233,2011-08-09,1," ON August , 2011 I was checking on my business account and noted that there was a withdrawal of $37.09 payable to LA Fitness- Irvine< California. I quickly contacted my bank and let them know that this transaction was unauthorized. Obviousally, someone at LA Fitness took this payment without verifying the identity of the individual that actually possesses the account, which is me. The thing is that the nearest LA Fitness to our residence is about 50 minutes north west of us. We use the gym that is located in our complex which is included in the rent. "
1315,218232,2011-08-09,2,"I wanted to address an article written in our local paper, North County Times, Riverside, regarding a woman who complained that Fox News was not on the television, however, she complained so much that management finally put it on. I do not belong to your club, but this is outrageous. Why should everyone working out be subjected to Fox Noise? Maybe you should turn them all off and let people bring their personal headphones. I am going to write the paper too. Sincerely,Lynda **"
1316,218231,2011-08-08,1,"La Fitness is a joke. People are there are very incompetent. They don't know what they are doing. For months I am trying to cancel my training with them and they give me the run around. They are taking money, which I do not have, out of my checking account and now every time I go look at my account, money is taken out. "
1317,218230,2011-08-08,1,"I had canceled both my gym membership and training membership due to financial hardships and I was also informed by a friend that Planet Fitness is a quarter of the price. I sent in the cancellation for both the membership and training. I received emails stating both would be cancelled. However, I am still being billed for the training. They will not let me cancel it unless I pay them for the services that I had not received. The national manager was not willing to work with me at all, even after I explained that I had not used any services in July and August and that I have no intentions to use them ever again. I feel that LA Fitness has horrible customer service. I work in a customer service industry and know that there is always something that you can do to help out a customer who is having a problem. I explained to the national manager that I am sure, as a multi-million dollar company, they have some type of customer courtesy button to fix customer's problems. All she kept saying is that there was a contract. I explained that due to financial hardships I am not able to continue my account with them. It was like that did not even matter. I also thought Bally's was worse than LA Fitness when it comes to customer service but even Bally's was willing to work with me a few years back.I will never join LA Fitness again, and I will ensure that I inform anyone else I know who wants to join a gym to never join LA Fitness.

1318,218229,2011-08-06,5,"I go to LA Fitness in Clifton, NJ and it is disgusting! I go to the gym at 5:00AM and weights are everywhere. The bathrooms for both genders are gross. I don't understand why this huge gym isn’t clean or in order. It’s a total mess and when you try to cancel your membership due to unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, you are not allowed. That gym needs to be closed down!"
1319,218228,2011-07-27,1,"I wanted to cancel my training membership due to the women I wanted to train with could not work with me in the evening due to my work schedule changing as well as hers. So I went online to cancel my account and sent away the ""cancellation form"" and heard nothing from LA Fitness--no letter, call, or email. I called a few weeks later just to inquire about the situation and they told me I can end my membership only at the end of my term, although this was not stated online before I filled out the information online and also did not on the cancellation. He said he understood and will call corporate. No one ever called back and when I called, they just kept giving me the runaround! The manager told me he would call corporate quite a few times and told me he would call me back and never did. I called back and finally spoke to A***** in Hamden, CT. He said he was the manager and refused to give me the corporation's telephone number and told me he was the only manager I could speak to due to him having the highest position. LA Fitness is a poor company with poor customer service skills. Management does nothing to solve the problems of their customers and I am sorry to have even started a membership with them."
1320,218227,2011-07-15,,"Here is a story of LA Fitness: I called the Alhambra Branch located at 412 East Main Street, Alhambra and spoke to a person named Tony. He offer me the membership at $799 for two years and then 99 for renew plan. I told him I will think about it. I called another branch in Pasadena at 201 S. Lake Avenue Pasadena, CA 91101 and the person who I contacted with was named Edward **. He gave me the same deal, except I only have to pay 600. So naturally, I took my time off work, drive to Pasadena (traffic was hell; took me over an hour drive, then I have to pay for the street parking as well) and signed up with Edward. Later that day, Tony called me and found out that I signed up with another branch. He then proceed to sabotage my deal on purpose (which I didn't give him any permission to look into my membership plan). He called his superior and then later I got a phone call from some guy from the Alhambra branch telling me the deal I have was canceled. He told me the deal I got was illegal. I asked him how was that not legal? I called your gym's phone number, spoke to your employee, got the quote from him. I drove down there to sign up for membership. At what point the action I did was illegal? He didn't answer. Then I asked for his name and his employee number and told him how I can know if he's legal and what he told me was legal. He gave me his name as Edward with no last name and did not give me his employee number. He then hung up the phone while I was yet to finish talking with him. I called back on the number he used to call me. They said there was no one named Edward working there. He basically lied on face. I now hold in my hand a legit contract of my membership, which I obtained through the normal legal process while I took time off my work. With just one phone call from them few hours later, it is now a worthless piece of paper. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS GYM. They deliberately sabotage their own customers and fight among themselves. They do not keep their word and they are not honest to themselves. They are by far NOT honest to their own customers. What you are dealing with is the worst of the worst of corporate America. Avoid LA Fitness at all cost. Never join them if you can. And feel free to copy this message into other forums or message board if you want. My email is **. I can provide you with all evidence. If you need a copy of the contract or my phone record, just email me. I want to expose to the world the true nature of LA Fitness."

I sent her back to tell people that she could not exercise that much due to her health problems. They of course told her she could quit at anytime which was a lie.

I was unclothed and ran into the bathroom stall to put on my suit. I was extremely embarrassed and felt very violated. It is clearly posted as a woman's locker room but no one is enforcing it. I put on my suit and went to do my exercise in the pool. Kids were in the pool just playing; kids were in the jacuzzi. I felt like I was swimming in a community pool. Conversions were inappropriate (as teenagers are) and I could not even find an area to swim -- too crowded with underage kids. I mentioned it to the receptionist and she stated that she was aware of kids in the pool and the adult jacuzzi but was too busy to ask them to leave. She did not know what to say about the dressing room except she was sorry and too busy to do anything about it. If I wanted to be naked in front of everyone, I would undress in the lobby!"

I was told by an associate that I could downgrade to another package where I would pay less than what I was paying at the moment and it would be less expensive than paying the penalty fee. I agreed and everything seemed well for a couple of months. However, after those months, my bill came out to a larger than life amount. I went into LA Fitness to speak with the supervisor to inquire what had happened with my bill. She informed me that she did not understand what had occurred the first time I went in and that what she was reading in the computer was that not only did I have the package deal with the cheaper payment but now I was also paying the original package deal. After further inquiry, she stated that the original package deal was frozen which was why I did not have a bill for those months. Further, she stated that the associate who did this no longer worked at LA Fitness and that there was nothing she could do. Now, I am stuck with a ridiculous bill that I cannot afford! What can I do? She is stating that it is in the computer system and she cannot do anything."
1324,59402,2011-06-09,,"I thought I had a ""freeze"" on my membership and I seen my account was charged $150 three months later for the previous three months. From my understanding, a freeze only cost $10 a month and was suppose to postpone my payments and my service was suspended form the gym for those months. I never signed a contract, they told me it was like prepaid. I only pay $40 for the months I use it and 10$ for the months I am on a freeze. So, I won't have to cancel my membership. Well, I called and spoke with Nancy, the manager and she told me even though it's not a contract I still pay for the months and I asked her how is that when I was paying 10$ for the freeze. She says whatever rep I spoke to didn't indicate I wanted the freeze and she didn't put notes in my account. Well, I have my telephone bill showing we talked for 25 minutes so, because the rep didn't have it in her notes, then I am just screwed? Nancy, the manager was very irate. She must of had a bad day, so finally I told her I'll just have my lawyer look into this manner and either I'll take it as a lost or they will have a law suit because if I'm paying to get my membership froze, why do I still need to pay the bill and I'm not on a contract. Well she got snarly and said I was going to refund it but go get your lawyer and hung up. Now this is the manager of LA fitness in Broadview, a new location, only been open less than 6 months. So, I called back and Amanda answered, asked to speak to Nancy again and she put me on hold, then hung up. I called again and Amanda answered again. I asked to speak to Nancy and told her she just hung up on me, she said, ""I hung up because Nancy left"" so, I say you couldn't tell me before hanging up and she cut me off and said, ""She is gone okay,"" then she thought she hung up but I clearly heard her and Nancy talking using the word ** talking bout black people and complaints with their bills and basically disrespecting my race trying to call us broke **. I was so happy, my old 78 year old grandmother was around to hear it and also my pastor."
1325,11608,2011-05-24,,"I started going to that gym with my friend that was there the day I paid to be in the gym. They explained everything to me about how the gym works. I asked them if I wanted to ever cancel with them for some reason and if I had to pay. They said no. So, I paid for a trainer. And I asked if I had to pay to cancel. Then, I wanted to cancel because it was too far to drive. It was like 2-hour drive so I found another closer gym to me. They now want $300 to cancel but then they won’t let me. They lied to me about the whole program. No gym in the world that I’ve been to have I ever had any problems with. All they care about is money and taking advantage of people's lives and money. They call me every day asking for money when I always paid them. And all I wanted to do was cancel and they won’t let me because they just want to keep taking money. The gym I’m in now, I only pay $25 a month and have no problems at all. I’m tired of companies like them trying to make people poor and take their money."

I went in on the 3rd day to cancel, which was also the day I had an appointment with the same man I worked with to set everything up to get started. I was told by the man at the front desk that “J** may not be coming back to this location"". I asked why he didn't call me, to advise me of this. The answer was, ""I don't know. I can't speak for him"". I asked for someone else as I needed to cancel the contract and this was the last day to do so. I was told I had to speak with C** who was at meetings all day. I was asked for my contact info and was told that he would call me back to take care of it. I received no call back. Ever since then it has been a pure nightmare! I have been bounced around so many times. Now since I am ""outside the recession period"", I can't get my money back. I have stopped by there 3 times and left numerous messages for various people. I even went to another location for help! Again, I ""have to speak with ** and he/she is the only one who can handle this.” When I was actually able to speak to ""a manager"", I was told to speak with the manager at the other gym. Surprisingly, he was not ""available"". The one woman I kept calling, T**, must have been answering the phones because when I identified myself, she asked if I could hold for ""a minute"". Then M** comes on the line telling me T** could not speak with me now!I know this situation has been bounced around to all these people. Even the supposed ""Customer Service line"" is a bunch of **! I felt like I would finally get some help! Then I get a message that nothing can be done. I feel this is a total scam! Duck & dodge is the game these people play! Yes, stupid of me to pre-pay, but had no idea this company would treat me this way. I strongly suggest people stay away from this place!"
1327,9532,2011-04-25,,"We were in Phoenix for spring training. We visited LA fitness in Camelback and decided to work out there for the month of March. We were told we would save money by signing up online. So we did. We were told to be sure to cancel online as we paid first and last month online. So we got to our last week and I went online to cancel our accounts. I couldn't do it online so I went to LA Fitness and told the gal at the counter to cancel our online accounts. She printed up a cancellation letter and told us to mail it in. So we did. Our accounts continued to be charged each week at the rate of $9.95. When they finally canceled our account, it was not the correct cancellation date. They kept $39.95 that we should not have had to pay. I emailed the online contact over and over that they needed to credit our account with the $39.95. I never received a reply so I called the Camelback fitness and spoke with someone there. He said he could only credit our account with $19.95. At that point I took it as I felt I would never get anything back if I didn't take it at that time. So they got $19.95 from us that they weren't entitled to. It seems they do that as a regular practice so they are greedy and ripping people off. I know the guys that work there in sales are very familiar with this practice as they mentioned in passing that some people who sign up online can't get canceled so they told us how to do it. His advice was incorrect and I know this is common practice to rip people off. I would never do business with LA Fitness again, ever!"
1328,7111,2011-03-09,,"On Tuesday, I was working out in the weight area with a group of members when a couple of the trainers came into the area yelling and provoking the members. They began shouting at us, demanding we follow gym procedures. A member attempted to talk with one of the trainers when he (the trainer) took a dumbbell and threw it to the club member, barely missing him. From there, the trainers continued their provocation and began to berate and intimidate the club members. At one point, one of the trainers told the members involved that ""those members who have voiced their dissatisfaction should be shot"". This same member even went as far as to insult us racially by calling us, ""Mexicans"". Now, the unprofessionalism demonstrated here shows a lack of leadership and customer service that should not be allowed. This employee is representing a national chain and should be more concerned with the safety of the paying members than his ego. My purpose in writing this letter is to inform and hopefully prevent any future such instances that creates not only a dissatisfactory experience for the members but also puts the members and any surrounding individuals in harm's way."

I visited the center and advised the desk clerk that I wish to cancel the memberships, at which time, she made some computer transaction and advised me that it was taken care of. My wife is the one paying the membership fees and she's unaware that I had cancelled the memberships. Therefore, she continues to pay LA Fitness from an automatic account deduction for an additional two years."

I was speaking with the sales rep regarding one of my concerns, then he called over the manager, Shaw, to handle my concern. Needless to say, Shaw basically told me he was not interested in my business. He treated me with disdain and he argued with me when I brought it to his attention. He did not show any respect for the customer. It was not a pleasant experience. I would not recommend anyone to join this club. It is really too bad because I was looking forward to joining the club."
1331,3759,2011-01-11,,"About a week into joining, I was approached in the middle of my workout by two of the representatives. (I guess because I am a young female, they figured I would be an easy target to persuade into their little trap.) They were really pushing the personal training and how it could get me where I want to be. So I agreed to sit down with them and hear them out. I was really hesitant, but the guy kept saying that I could freeze the training at any time, for however long I want. I ended up signing a 12-month contract, in which I was stupid enough not to read thoroughly before signing. After my first month, I decided to cancel the personal training because I didn't think the 30 minutes I was getting each session was worth the money. When I called the gym, this was when the whole thing unraveled. First, he told me that the only way to get out of the contract is if I had a medical note saying I couldn't work out anymore, or if I pay 50% of what was left of my contract. This would set me back roughly $300! Those snakes! So I asked to freeze it, and then he informed me that I would be charged $15 for every month it is frozen. Keep in mind that none of this information was mentioned to me at the time of signing the contract.It amazes me how a company that supports and encourages this kind of dishonest behavior can still stay in business for this long. There has got to be a law against misrepresentation of a contract and scamming people out of their money. I would love to be around to see this entire company crumble to the ground and all their employees end up on the streets, because they are all acting like scum already.This entire experience has been a nightmare that they continue to make more difficult. It does not cost them $300 to go into their computer and cancel my membership, but they are so relentless on dragging this out. I want to get the word out about this company to where, eventually, everyone will know the LA Fitness name to be a scam gym."

At the tune of $599.04. I've read all the other complaints about this gym and would like join a class action suit or start one. Apparently, I'm not the only person this has happened to."

I told her that I never received any form nor anything in the mail. She was not very helpful. This is ridiculous. If this is a professional environment, then this is not it. I have a negative in my account because of them. They didn't explain anything to me nor how I needed to cancel my membership. This has caused me a lot of stress.

With the verbal understanding this was for 3 months. I got nothing for free. Instead I signed up for 34.95 a month cancelled with 30 days notice. They also talked me into a trainer $78 per month 3 sessions for 30 minutes each. I was told I would never wait for a machine, Lie #1. I was told if I ever needed assistance I could grab a trainer at random for help, lie #2. I was told if someone was monopolizing a machine I wanted I could grab a front desk person to get them to move on lie #3 (front desk staff cannot leave the front desk). The ladies locker room was always filthy. The dry sauna and steam often broken for days.When with my trainer we had to wait for equipment thus wasting my time. After 3 months, I let Jack know I was unhappy and canceling. He said I could not and stated I had signed for year. The contract that I signed does say at bottom it's a year contract and you can do a buy out of 6 months but only get to use 3 months if you do that (pay double another words).I tried to make it work for a couple more months but by June 2010 had had enough of their dirty gym, lousy customer service and lies. I canceled by website (their preferred method) July 2010. Now they are still charging my credit card $78 a month for training services I am not using and do not want.They fast talked me into joining, all along distracting me so that I would not read the entire contract and just got roped in by their verbal contractual promises. I have a witness to this effect who was there sitting with me when this all happened and will go to court with me if need be (Nicholas **).

I had in July and the Gym would work with you or refund you any money and they consider this is not a contract agreement where very clearly it says Membership Agreement. Even it says for a quicker refund go to one of LA Fitness location and I did that and they told me they can not do anything. They agree to cancel and extend the time, so use the last month tuition so they don't have to refund anything to consumer and I said that is right for the people that doesn't have an emergency or medical condition but someone that had involved, they should not apply that policy of them.

They kept charging me month after month of training and membership fees even after I kept going in there and giving them 3 doctor notes (of course one has disappeared). They refunded some of my money, but owe me about $600 more. This situation has had me so completely stressed out, as I am trying to recover from major surgery. I have to worry about what LA fitness will charge me. I ended up seeing my doctor over major chest pains, and had a chest x ray to make sure nothing was wrong.

The men's locker room and the showers have garbage, hair, razors, and band-aids on the floor. I talked to the manager and he became agitated and very defensive. He would not even sit down with me and practically walked away rudely. I wonder why a company that takes in a fortune and has thousands of membership holders, risks its reputation and the health of customers for the price of a few cleaning personnel.

He seemed sincere and may have believed what he told me. The sessions were terrible. Often they did not show and when one did, they talked to their friends, answered phone, and did nothing more than put me on a machine and state how many reps to do. However, my complaint is not about that first year of horror. After the year I agreed, the gym ""automatically"" changed my account to month to month and continued to charge me $120 a month. The salesman looked me in the eye and guaranteed that this could and would not happen as it was against New York’s states law. I called to ask for a refund for the months beyond the first year. I was not even seeking a refund from the first year of training that was not used because of the young unprofessional staff they hired. They said that while the salesman was correct in stating the contract was good for a year, what he did not mention was that after that, it would go right to month to month. I was lied to right to my face. Now I have 90 session and out over $2,000. Again, I really was only seeking a refund from the second year that I was promise would never occur."

Being California as home to a lot of leftists, I assume they are blocking Fox because it is the only news network telling the truth about our government leftists. The front desk person sympathized with me and suggested I could write to corporate because he gets many requests from members to put Fox on the TVs. How about totally disrespecting the American public and its members' requests? How about the hypocrisy of the left, they always want tolerance but will not tolerate anything but their own viewpoint."
1355,43587,2010-09-20,,"In June, Ron approached me after I was coming out from the gym. He made me sit next to him and he talked about me having a personal trainer. He showed me one person and said that he is very good. I am a polite person so I just said to him that I have knee problem. I only go there for water exercise and that I was also going for a knee operation so I don't need any trainer right now. He said okay. As per bank, I canceled my two credit cards. This month, they tried to take the money but the bank declined. Please help me. They already took $600 from me before I canceled my card. Where is justice here? Mentally, I am very upset. Without a job, I am trying to meet both ends. Oh my God, what a cruel-minded people. My name is Mary ** and I have no money to give to lawyers. God is my attorney."
1356,42675,2010-09-14,,"I canceled my membership online in July. At least I thought I did as I got the cancellation confirmation online once it completed. I can't be sure if I received an email verification, however, and cannot locate it in my email. I knew I'd be stuck paying an extra month and my last payment would be in August, which I was fine with, though not altogether happy, and thought that was the end of it. (I think this is a bogus policy that you must pay an additional full month once you wish to cancel your membership. It should be after the full billing cycle completes.) But today, I was charged another month's membership fee.I called the store to find out what went wrong and see if this charge could be taken off and spent 30 minutes+ on the phone with the manger Jeff trying to get this taken care of. He was condescending and kept repeating his programmed talking points at me the entire conversation, telling me I needed to go online to do the cancellation. When I kept explaining what happened, he just repeated the same thing he said, “Go online and put in a cancellation.” When I said I did not want to be stuck with this extra $35 after I already tried to cancel 2 months ago, he suggested I talk to the corporate office. The only problem was he could not provide me with a contact number for corporate. When I continued to ask for a number of someone I could talk to, he just kept repeating that I needed to go online. There is no corporate number provided on the website. Apparently, my cancellation did not go through as I had thought. He insisted there was nothing he could do on his end, that he did not have the authority to reverse a charge on a card or issue a credit for the charge. It was only much later into the conversation, once I asked to speak to his supervisor, that he told me he was the store manager. I told him I found it hard to believe that as manager of the store, he could not authorize the refund on my charge. He proceeded to try to get rid of me by trying to end the call before I was through. I asked to speak to his manager, and he refused to give his number. He said it was the company policy that the regional manager's phone number was not to be given out. I continued to insist that I have the opportunity to speak to his manager, and he kept refusing. After much back and forth, he offered up the fact that he was a new manager, only on the job for two months and he did not wish to lose his job over giving me a refund for a month's charge. He even suggested he mail me a check out of his own pocket to pay the $35, because he could not authorize the transaction in store, and that it is corporate policy not to issue refunds in this type of case. We continued to rehash the situation, during which time he pretended we hadn't been through the whole scenario and changed his tone of voice and told me I needed to go on the website to ""contact us"" (which only provides numbers to the stores). I told him I either wanted this taken care of today, or I wanted to speak to his manager. He said there was nothing he could do. I said, ""You just said you could send me $35. I don't want your money, but I want a refund on this charge."" He told me he wasn't going to pay my bills for me. He tried to get rid of me again and in fact basically hung up on me. I called back and he gave me a quick answer and hung up before I could get much out. I called back a second time and told him I was going to keep calling until I had this situation resolved. He then told me he would have someone at corporate contact me directly to see what could be done. This is where I am left.The whole situation has left a very bad taste in my mouth about the company. This is after I went through a very similar situation a few years ago when I canceled my LA Fitness membership at a different location after moving. I had canceled the training a while back, but after I canceled my store membership, they continued to bill me for training that I was not only not using, but had in fact completed the short-term contract agreement on. I ended up leaving with about $200 they claimed I owed on my membership for miscellaneous training fees and other fees, after I was forced to cancel the credit card they were billing me on because they would not stop charging my credit card. A couple of years later, I got an email inviting me to rejoin LA Fitness at my old rate and all outstanding fees would be waived. I needed a new gym, so I joined. And now I'm back full circle with the same type of scenario again, because I've moved again to a location where there is no LA Fitness nearby. This really makes me angry. It's only $35, but $35 is $35. I'm even angrier about the fact that I have wasted an hour of my time on this between the phone call with the manager and taking the time to write this post."
1357,41371,2010-09-07,,"All you need to do is read the other complaints about LA Fitness on this website. My experience is exactly the same. It is nearly impossible to cancel a contract. Although the contract specifies a certain number of payments to be charged to your credit card and the beginning date, all very clearly set out in a box. In another section it says they continue charging until you cancel. Why should I have to take action when I specifically told them how many months of personal training I wanted and that I did not want a longer contract? And why can't I just go to the health club and take care of the cancellation on their computers rather than having to send a certified letter? The person who answered the phone at the corporate office was combative and not at all helpful. Don't join! They will bilk you as long as they can. Join the YMCA---it's cheaper and when I needed to cancel that due to an injury, I was able to walk in and cancel with a short, cordial conversation with the part-time employee at the front desk. No hassle, no argument, no automatic charges to my account to try to get reversed. "
1358,40796,2010-09-03,,"This complaint is a reflection against the policy of LA Fitness' corporate office. It is almost impossible to get a refund if you cancel your membership and that in itself is an event! The system is designed to milk former members of money that is due them. I am going to involve ""3 on your Side"" to see if I can get what is owed to me! As someone else said, it's not a lot of money, it's the principle! "
1359,40549,2010-09-02,,"Like others noted above, I too, have had a horrific experience with LA Fitness. After canceling my wife's membership, my credit card continued to be charged. I contacted the credit card company and the charges were removed. Three months later, I went to work out and was told that my membership was cancelled by the LA Fitness Corp. Office. I was told by the club manager that the reason for the cancellation was directly related to my questioning the post cancellation charges associated with my wife's membership. Where does this company get off with the viral gorilla business practices? I intend to file a complaint with the State Attorney General’s office. I also encourage others with similar experiences to do so also."
1360,40369,2010-09-01,,I froze my membership in June because I could not find my key and because I was going out of the country. I came to find out that it was frozen for only one month and then activated in a different city. I was charged and am continuing to be charged without using the membership. I also canceled my son's membership in July and they say they never received it and am continuing to get charged. I have been to the facility and spoken to several people and no one can help or reimburse me. I continue to get charged and will have to start the process all over again. They say I need to talk to corporate but cannot find a number. $148 with $148 more since I will have to start the process all over again.
1361,40335,2010-09-01,,They have a ridiculous cancellation policy and they also disconnected all corporate phone numbers. There is no way to contact anyone and check to see if your cancellation letter has arrived and will be processed in enough time to not be billed for the next month. You have to go through the clubs where the staff are all morons. I’m in the middle of the cancellation process now. I hate these people.
1362,40260,2010-09-01,,"This is the story of phone calls and text message spams/harassment during work hours! I paid for membership and was a member for two to three months. One day, I got an automated call during work about getting my family membership. I turned it off. The next time I went to the gym, I asked one of the front desk worker politely to not call me during work hours, 9 to 5. He said he'll take me off. The next day, I got text message about getting my family membership to LA fitness. I called them, talked to the manager, and told him I've asked a man working at the front counter once already. Please do not call or text me. I told them, that I'm a freelancer, and that I need my cell phone to be free, stop this. A week later they called me and left me a voice message and a text message about family membership deal. I was furious. I called them back after work hours, asked them to let me talk to their supervisor. I asked the supervisor for his name and his last name. He would not provide me with his last name nor transfer me to a higher supervisor. I told him that the last two time I didn't ask for a name, this time, I'm making sure that if he fail to stop LA fitness from calling me, at least I got a name to report it to as proof. He told me he didn't understand my logic for his last name and hanged up on me. I was furious and called back and started cussing at him. I asked him why the ** did he hang up on me? He said I was cussing. I told him I didn't cuss until now.I got proof because I gave them my Google voice/phone number. The text message and their automated voice messages are on there. Anyway, I missed a very important work related call but thankfully I've salvaged it. But I end up canceling the membership and my credit card, reported to the BBB. Another reason why LA Fitness is bad for you guys is: They do not have padding on barbell to do squat. They don't have a designated place to do deadlift. I do 255 lbs deadlift for a 5'5'' size okay. I drop that sometime and it bangs pretty loud. Any decent gym would have a deadlift and squat equipments and places. Their 45's are crack around the holes and their dumbbells are old. The rubber covers are coming off. There are certain exercise you cannot do because the bench is bolt down or they just don't have the equipment for it. So if you strength exercise or just body build they are very lacking in it.There was no weighing machine either! Their equipment was broken so they bought some Costco one in front desk. You have to ask for it and they'll look at you and ask, ""Are you a member?"" Really? You really think I'm going to steal your bad Costco weight machine? Their gym trainers are ** too. The free assessment check is b***p. They tried to ask you what you want. If you don't know what you want, they'll do as very little as possible unless it seems like they can get you to pay for a trainer. I've seen people got jipped by this. I asked him for an overall fitness test and he took my pulse and gave me a BMP measurement and said I'm done. Pointed to a chart and said you're in 15% percentile, above average good job, later. Some of the gym trainers don't even know what they're doing.They don't offer many physical programs just sport. Judo and such isn't in there. Oh, I tried their pool once, got the stomach flu right afterward. Sick for a week cause of that. Why am I blaming it on the pool? Because I've never gotten the stomach flu before, not even when I worked out. The pool was the only out of the ordinary thing I've done, habitual person. This is the gym in Alhambra. I don't know about the other branches. But those bean counters working in LA Fitness headquarter doesn't care about the condition of their free weights.Oh here's the text message: ""Join us! This weekend, member appreciation. 0 enrollment for family at LA FITNESS. Bring a friend and get a 1 week trial membership free. David ***."" Probably the same that hanged up on me. I'm not sure but he's afraid of losing his job so he's not going to tell me his last name over the phone nor in person. I'm just so frustrated and *** right now. Go over to eopinions, BBB, or Yelp, they have hundred plus complaints. They managed to get an A rating for some reason. Over at Yelp with less than 30 reviews, there are people that got sick from that place too! Bottom line, they want your money. They will spam you with calls and text messages, during work hours, asking for your family members to join. To cancel membership, you have to go online, register, print out a cancellation letter and mail it."
1363,39802,2010-08-30,,"I am Patrick's father and just attempted to place my son's membership on temporary hold due to his having suffered a massive stroke. When I contacted the local facility where he has been a member for several years, I was treated like a common individual and told that he would still be liable for September's billing and that there would be a $10 per month service charge just to keep him in their system indefinitely. This Natalie hung the phone up on me stating that I was being unreasonable. Go figure these heartless people out. We will be pursuing the corporate route but can only say that this has been an emotional struggle just to get our son's business in order so we may concentrate on his rehab, only to have an organization like this treat us without any respect for our son's situation."
1364,39602,2010-08-28,,"On Sunday, August 22, 18:30 when using LA Fitness swimming pool, my locker was robbed. The lock was cut off and all my belongings were stolen, including wallet with ID and credit cards, health insurance cards, cash $140, car and home keys, $500 smartphone. At the club there was no person who even was able to call police (apparently it is corporate policy not to call, as I was told). There was no way to write a report/complain. There are no security cameras at all at the facility. I was told manager would call me next day, but a week later none called. Yes, I was allowed to use the phone to call wife to pick me up. When asked to replace my admission bar code card, stolen at their facility, I was charged $5 and when asked to void that charge, I was offered to cancel my membership, if I did not want to pay. This is a thank you I got for being more than 10 years member of that club. The result of the occurrence was identity theft, some charges on my credit cards before canceling them out that day for $450, cost of replacement car keys and home locks for $500. In addition that day, the thieves tried to enter my home to steal more, but luckily I called police in time. The suspects did run away. "

I canceled my membership 1 week after the month ahead of payment date and ended up having to pay a whole extra month! When I called them to explain what happened, they were very rude and even hung up one me! It wasn't the $29.99 that I had to pay for a gym I couldn't use. It was the principle of the situation. You have to mail in your cancellation via snail mail. think this helps them ensure it is late(!) and in today's economy and the job market you would think they would be more considerate and understanding to a member that may actually rejoin at some point. I will never rejoin(!) as I do not spend my hard earned money to be treated with complete disregard! We weary of joining this gym. I recommend Golds or Lifetime or anywhere else for that matter."

The trainer and I realized that my brother needed more of a physical therapist because it was hard work, so I asked for my money back and no was the answer. No. I asked to see the manager and s/he was non existent. When I asked to see the guy who had registered me, I was told that he was fired the same day. My brother and I were very distraught after this. He needed the work or the money to go elsewhere. What should I do? This happened in February--after the earthquake in Haiti--where we were."
1368,37971,2010-08-20,,"After reading problem comments about canceling a membership at LA Fitness, I faced the process with some trepidation. I asked a young fellow for help at the LA Fitness in Los Colinas, TX. He quickly found the needed account, printed the form I needed to mail, folded it and stapled it for me to mail and suggested I send it certified. In less than a week I had confirmation of a timely cancellation. I couldn't have wished for more. Good luck to those with problems."
1369,37729,2010-08-19,,"I had called regarding several questions, one of which I was inquiring about was the differences in the levels of LA Fitness membership. It is my understanding that I have the highest level of membership possible, allowing me to go to any gym location. Becky told me that the ""gym membership"" which I have is the one in Sugar Land, which is the highest level. I know for a fact that the gym in the Houston medical center is nicer/has higher level offering TV/iPod, accessible cardio machines, towels, etc. that the Sugar Land location does not offer. I did ask to speak to someone else that may be better able to help me, but Becky just talked right over me in an authoritarian voice. At my request for clarification regarding when prices may go down, Becky became verbally rude/offensive to me, stating that I ""keep interrupting her"" when I was merely trying to seek clarification. Becky also had difficulty relaying to me current monthly payment rules/regulations. I felt she spoke to me in a very inferior manner. And I feel this should be known so that it may not happen to another LA Fitness member."
1370,37311,2010-08-17,,"I took out a membership with LA Fitness in April 2010. Found that I had to move to North Carolina in June 2010, so I went into the facility and spoke to the receptionist and told her I had to cancel my membership. She said she noted the system that it was canceled and gave me forms that I would need to send to Corp. Told me there would probably be one more payment taken out July 8, 2010 but nothing after that. When I got to North Carolina, I sent the letter and the signed forms to Corporate and requested a return verification that this was done. I was in North Carolina until August 8, 2010, but never received a letter. Then I noticed that LA Fitness took another payment out of my checking account for August. I called the club and was told that my account was not canceled and that I would have to call back the next day and speak to someone else. I cannot find an 800 # to call LA Fitness. I called my bank and told them that I wanted the withdrawals to stop because I had canceled my membership in June. They are filing a complaint and will send me the paperwork I need to stop the payments in the future. Now I just have to figure out how to get in touch with someone at LA Fitness to get this stopped. My daughters account was canceled per her request but don't know why they can't seem to cancel mine and I even sent in all the forms they needed. I hope this does not continue but I can see from other members that it might be a difficult thing to deal with. I wish I had never signed up with them if this is what they are going to do."

1372,36665,2010-08-14,,"To anyone who wants to sign up for a gym, do not go to LA Fitness! Here's why: I was not a member of LA Fitness before this, so Dan, the employee who signed me up, told me that I needed to open an account and pay the registration fee, first and last monthly fees, along with other fees that are associated with being a member, before I was able to sign up for training sessions. Disappointed in the money I had to pay up front, to only be a gym member to use a trainer for 2 months, I paid the $300 fee, even when I told him I wasn't going to use the gym itself, only to utilize the trainer. After the membership aspect was taken care of, he proceeded to tell me about training session packages. I specifically wanted to do 1 or 2 months worth of training at LA Fitness only. Dan was well aware of this because I mentioned this numerous times during our meeting together. He told me that it'll be no problem for me to sign up for a year's worth of training and told me after 2 months, to call and cancel my account. I specifically asked him if I will have any problems cancelling my account early and if I was responsible for a cancellation payment or any other type of payment after the 2 months was up, and he confidently told me ""no, everything will be taken care of them. "" After the 2 months of training was up, and a couple hundred dollars later, I cancelled my LA Fitness account using the online website without any complication, assuming that my training account was linked to my membership account and that too, will also be cancelled. I was then charged another $45 the following two months after my account was already cancelled. I called LA Fitness and the woman who helped me credited my account one time, only for $45, when it should have been $90. I explained I only wanted to be a member for 2 months and I already paid up front the first and last month's fees and should not be charged for 2 additional months. I tried contacting the manager numerous times, leaving my name and number to correct this situation. I was told each time that he will call me back. When I called back a couple days later, the manager, Tom, was finally available. He told me that I had to speak with another member of the team to get the other $45 credited back to my account, which that person is not there at the moment. I told him my frustration about this situation, but he just reiterated that I needed to speak with this person to get that credited back to my account. I soon found out from LA Fitness that I was responsible to pay 50% of the remaining balance after I cancelled my training account. One important step Dan never mentioned to me while I was signing up. The terms of the contract were not explained properly and I had been misled from a supposed ""trained"" employee. After I found this information out, I went back to speak with this employee, only to find out he does not work at LA Fitness anymore! I called the training manager and general manager of LA Fitness numerous times, again, without any call backs. Finally, when I did get a hold of them, the only thing they were able to tell me was to call Corporate and explain my situation. This is the reason I was charged for another 2 months at $45 each time was due to the fact that my training account was not cancelled, even though my LA Fitness account was cancelled. I spoke with 2 or 3 different people from Corporate who claimed they were managers and were not understanding about my situation. They were all very cold and accused me of not reading my contract thoroughly and asking questions to the LA Fitness employee. They were disrespectful and just mentioned over and over again that they were able to suspend my account for a month, then, I was to pay the 50% of the remaining balance the following month-- almost $1000! That is the only thing they were able to do for me. Never did any of them say ""I'm sorry this happened to you,"" instead they pretty much verbally attacked me! On top of the $300 I had to pay for becoming a member of LA Fitness--a gym I never actually used to work-out, unless I had a training session and was working with the trainer-- I had to pay another $150 for trainer registration fees. With the cash I spent, all I got was a training log booklet! $40 for a half-hour session for training, on top of the $150 trainer registration fee, $45 a month to continue to be a member of a gym that I rarely went to, along with the other misunderstood fees is outrageous. I really feel like I wasted my time and money!Why can't a person sign up with a trainer instead of becoming a member of the gym, if they do not plan to utilize the gym any other time? Their employee made a significant error while opening up a new account and they have the responsibility as a large, well known company to fix the situation and see that a reasonable solution can be provided. Both the gym and training managers at the LA Fitness I went to are incompetent and lazy and ""pass the buck"" to other employees when they are unaware of what to say or do. I was under the impression the LA Fitness employee who signed me up was trained and competent in his position and would offer the full facts before signing a potential customer. I would also assume the managers would help a customer and not have them call back on numerous occasions to get an answer to their question.On top of this, I called Corporate one morning, only to be on hold for 10 minutes, when a voice message comes on and says the office is closed until 9am Pacific time. Why was I on hold for that long just to be told by an answering machine that the offices are closed? So, later on I called my local club to get the name and number of the district manager--thinking they would definitely have it. They had no email address or name they could give me! This time, I called corporate back later (business hours, now), to get the district manager's name and email address-- only to find that NO ONE had it! This is Corporate that I'm calling and NO ONE has the district manager's email address? After being transferred from person to person--someone was able to give me the email address and name--only when I emailed my complaint letter, did it bounce back. Again, I called Corporate up again, and some gentleman heard my frustration and gave me the correct email address. 2 weeks went by and I have not heard anything yet from the district manager. I sent another email, again without a response. This is the district manager we're talking about here--shouldn't he be checking his emails frequently? So, while I was on vacation I had to call Corporate yet again because I have been back and forth with a billion people for over a month about this situation, to complain to that ""manager"" about the situation and mentioned the district manager has not contacted me back. Surprisingly, after I brought up the word ""lawyer"" and ""writing to magazines and newspapers"" about my ordeal, the very next day I got a call and email from the district manager. He said he never got my 2 other emails (yeah right). He too was very cold and not understanding. The whole 45 minute long phone call, I was pretty much defending myself. Overall, things went my way after I mentioned writing to local newspapers and magazines. Worst place ever! Do not sign up with LA Fitness!"

LA Fitness had a pool and several classes throughout the week. I was able to utilize the pool for approximately one to two weeks, then the pool was shut down. Due to circumstances beyond control, the pool has remained closed. On or about July 20, 2010, I called to ask that my membership fee of $264.98 (paid on May 17, 2010) be returned and that my monthly fees of $19.99 be stopped as I wanted to cancel my membership due to failure on LA Fitness' part to honor (or comply) with the use of the pool. I was told that my account would be put on ""freeze"" and I could come in and try other classes to see if any other classes would help me heal from my back surgery.I tried one step class on or about Saturday, August 7, 2010. The instructor was late and I had a hard time with the choreography. On Tuesday, August 10, 2010, I arrived at 5:35 to attend the 5:45 step class. At approximately 5:55, an individual came into the step room and announced that there was no instructor for the class.

1375,35946,2010-08-10,,"The LA Fitness in Rowlett, Gym no. 080543 has steadily declined in repair, cleanliness, and security over the past 4 years since opening. Serious issues are present throughout the gym inside and out, including the men's locker room which smells like month old rotting clothes as they have apparently never steam clean the carpet. I hardly ever seen them vacuum, and I hesitate to imagine what vile disease lurks in the carpet judging by the wreck that looms. The spin class bikes are always in disrepair as they purchased the cheapest ones they could find and refuse to replace them. At any given time, a third of the spin bikes have something wrong with them. Either the bearings for the peddle axle is wobbling and dangerous, or the resistance bands are over tightened or loose, and or the seats are broken. It's always Russian Roulette choosing a bike as a large percentage of the time, you end up on a broken bike, making the experience miserable. Upon complaining to the instructors, they all know and agree that the bikes are junk and point to the Richardson LA Fitness that has wonderfully equipped bikes that are always well-maintained. They simply tell us to complain to management as the 'more complaints they receive' the more likely we are to get new bikes. After 2 years of numerous complaints by numerous patrons, it's obvious that it's never going to happen. Management has been informed numerous times and has done nothing to rectify the situation other than send in the one repair guy who handles several other clubs twice a week to tinker for a few minutes and leave. He simply spins the wheel with his hand once, pushes on the pedals for a second, and moves on. Nobody ever verifies that the bikes actually operate properly with a person on them. The Nautilus elliptical machines are constantly in a state of brokenness, with either the bearings squealing, the buttons broken, the foot platforms coming loose (dangerous), and or the unit being completely out of commission (a third have broken signs on them year round). The other ellipticals are similar in that many of them have bearings that are shot and wobble incessantly during use.Of serious concern is the third of the lights around the building and in the parking lot that are burned out and have been for 12 weeks. After complaining to the front desk and management on six separate occasions, nothing has been done. At night, there are huge gaping black holes around the building, making some places in the parking lot down right dangerous just to walk to find your car. Much more concerning is just the lack of security walking in pitch black with nobody around, and plenty of shadows for people to lurk in. After talking to management at a separate LA Fitness location, they blamed property management and said it wasn't LA Fitness’ responsibility to make sure the lights on the outside of the building made it safe for gym patrons at night. They literally said it wasn't their problem if something bad happens because they refuse to get the lights on the outside of the building fixed. In essence, it appears they care more about the bottom line than the safety of their patrons. After multiple vehicles were stolen from the parking lot at the gym in Rowlett, they refused to install cameras in the parking lot. Finally, the thieves got caught by the local Target’s camera. (You'd think a gym would care more about their patrons than this?) If you're going to be open to midnight, get some cameras and fix the lights!In an effort to 'freshen up' the place, they recently threw paint on some walls, and removed broken water fountains (instead of actually repairing or replacing them). They even put new stands on the monitors at the front desk so they wouldn't have to man it anymore. So half the time, there isn't anyone at the front desk anymore to help with anything at all. After being informed that their $130 dollar medical grade scale (the same one you see at a doctor's office) isn't working right, they send in the repair guy to shoot more screws in it. Regardless of the fact that it has been dragged across the floor by the janitors for six months straight, and the parallel bar won't even balance out properly when measuring anymore. They insist that they've had someone look at it. People complain that it never reads right, and they are correct as it is barely plus or minus 5 pounds accurate as damaged as it is. Upon asking a manager at another LA Fitness about the issue, they simply retort that we'll 'never get another scale' as Texas was a test market and they're not replacing scales with new ones. In essence, they should yank the scale as it's not even remotely accurate, yet they continue to feign ignorance of the fact that they'll never replace it. Either that or the other manager was blowing smoke about it and had no idea what she was talking about. In either case, it's wrong for them to continue to feign ignorance about issues and lead customers on that things will ever change when they know for a fact they won't.It's very obvious that LA Fitness must have a 30/70 rule where if 70 percent of the gym is functional, it's 'good enough'. What's somewhat humorous is that the manager at this particular gym is never behind the front desk and is never doing anything other than sales. It stands to reason that he has no time to actually manage the gym if all he ever does is try to bring in new clients. Of course, it does no good if they're losing customers faster than they're gaining. Long story short, the gym used to be in good repair, used to not smell like a week old dirty sock, and used to have management that actually fixed things (the first year they were open). After that, everything went to trash. Buyer beware, there are other options out there!"
1376,35195,2010-08-05,,"I talked to a manager over the phone and requested to cancel my membership. She did some typing in her computer, said sorry to see you go, and told me my last day that I could go to the gym. Four months later, I got a call from LA Fitness saying my card wasn't working for my payment. Because of fraud it was cancelled, and they wanted a payment. I told them I had cancelled my membership 4 months ago. So they referenced me to corporate. I called corporate and told them how I had cancelled. She asked me if I had sent in the required paperwork to cancel my membership. I told her that I was never informed about any paperwork. So she then said that she would be happy to cancel my membership now and I asked what about the 4 months I paid and never attended the gym? She said she couldn't do anything about it and that I should have caught it in my bank statements that I was being charged. So, basically, I am out of my $90-$120 and I am no longer in support of LA Fitness."
1377,34970,2010-08-04,,"My husband called in to freeze our personal training like we have been doing since May. This is the second time they have taken money out of our account without authorization. I guess the problem is that Nick, the person who is charge of refunds, does want to refund anything. When my husband went down to LA Fitness, he told him that the reason why he refunded last time was because he felt sorry for us! I just think it's very unfair the way the are taking customers money. The reason why they had to refund was because the person who messed up on our account pretty much took the blame, but this time everyone is just ignoring us. We have been going thru financial difficulties and we need help to get our money refunded."

1379,34198,2010-07-31,,"LA Pro Results Personal Training is a scam!! I am so upset that I fell for this company's **. I joined a local LA fitness where they forcefully encourage you to get a health assessment, that's the time they plan to corner you and push you into signing up for a monthly trainer. Don't do it. I am a nurse and had to cancel one of my training sessions with less than a 24-hr notice because I was mandated to work overtime. They said that it would count as one of my sessions, and this is just a piece of my frustration with them. I went in to cancel and they told me they didn't have the authority to do it there. They gave me the number of corporate who were even worse people to talk to because they refused to allow me to cancel unless I paid 50% of my training agreement balance. My membership was less than a month old and I had only used 2 sessions and already been charged 190.00. So now I'm looking at paying 500.00 to buy out, and all together, I would have paid 700.00 for 3 weeks of gym use and 2 training sessions all because they refuse to call it a wash and cancel the payment plan (they've already got me for about 100.00 per training session). I thought I was being very generous paying that much. I can't believe this is legal, they prey on overweight people who are so ashamed of themselves as they look at a buff trainer, that they don't realize they're (I'm) being scammed until it's too late. By end, I will be $700.00+ dollars out, plus what I'll lose when I cancel my LA Fitness membership. There's a significant financial strain, as my car died one week after signing up with LA Pro Results training, and I was forced to enter into a car payment (This, I also explained to ""corporate"" with no resolve; they didn't care)."
1380,32292,2010-07-21,,"On 02/14, I signed up for a personal trainer in LA Fitness with an agreement of $1589 for 30 sessions. It was also explained that I can take my time using my sessions with no penalties of losing any of my paid sessions. I have now been charged a total amount of $3029 for additional training session I didn't signed up for. Since my account is automatically withdrawn from the account, additional payments have been charged. Since an additional premium of $1440 was taken out of the account, this has resulted to over drafting the account."
1381,31903,2010-07-20,,"I went into the Monterey Park location for a cycle on Sunday, 07/18/2010, at approximately 9:05 am for cycle class at 9:15 am. We scanned our cards as usual. And as usual, there was no greeting. We just scanned and we went to use the restroom prior to the class. The men’s restroom was a mess and all the stalls, toilet paper, and seat covers were thrown everywhere. And one stall had feces all over it. It was horrible. I found a semi clean stall and cleaned seat. I used the restroom only to find out there was no toilet paper. So needless to say, I needed to get up after using the restroom and walk to another stall and wipe. Yes, wipe! Mind you, my class was going to start in like three minutes. Prior to all this while I was walking from the main counter to the restroom, they had their announcements (recording) playing overhead, thanking their customers, guests, and staff. They were indicating that if you had any problem, please approach any of their staff and they would be happy to help. Well, after I finished my business, I walked to the first person I saw and that was a young man in a black shirt sitting at sales desk with a lady. I walked up to him and politely let him know the men’s restroom was a mess and needed some service. It was at this point he took attitude and said I should wait a minute and he would be with me. And he did this with a finger up!I let him know I did not appreciate the attitude. He told me he was with a client and wait. I told him all I was doing was giving him information regarding the quality of his restroom. And I asked for manager. He said he was the manager. I said that he was poor excuse for a manager. He proceeded to engage me and got up as I was walking away. He followed me to a dividing wall and said “come here, get over here” like I was a child. I told him at that point he was a punk kid and I continued to walk up the stairs towards the class. He followed me half way up the stairs yelling that my membership was revoked and I could leave then as he met me on the stairs. He almost engaged me like he wanted to fight. He walked up to me and said I’m not afraid of you.This was getting really out of control. So finally, he said he was calling security, for what? I’m not sure. Maybe I hurt his feelings for pointing out the obvious. So as he walked down the stairs, I realized class had started and was full. So I told my son, “Let’s just leave.” Freddie was already on PA calling security and nobody came. So, I went to front counter area. I waited for security. It was at that point the manager came up to me again and was running his mouth like he was talking to kids. I think he may have taken care of children before. I’m not sure. In any case, he was walking towards us like he wanted to actually fight. So, I told, “Come on. Let’s go outside.” He came towards me fast and then went towards the safety of his front counter. He slammed the door and continued to tell me my membership was revoked and acted very smugly!Yes, I did use some expletives at this point because he was way out of line. And I called him a punk because the word fits! On Monday, I called the corporate office. I filed a complaint and was told they would have the main manager from that location (Francisco) call me. I figured I would get some call with apology for the incident. But I was wrong. I got no call back. So, I called and spoke with the manager. He told me that Freddie’s story and mine were different and there were always two sides to every situation. I agreed. Then, he said Freddie and us could have a meeting to resolve the issue. I said okay later today but I would call back at like 12:30 pm to verify. I called back and he said Freddie would not be attending or apologizing for his actions, which was no surprise to me because he also advised me that he felt intimated and uncomfortable with me. This was amazing to me because he seemed so aggressive the day before and said he was not scared of me. Mind you, I am 5’5” and 170 lbs. and he was a bit taller and about 155 lbs. So, I’m not sure where that was coming from. In any case, I told him to review tapes and that would tell the story. He said he did not think that was necessary.I went in that night and spoke to Francisco. He was diplomatic and arrogant in his approach towards the situation. He was almost like I hear what you’re saying but it was not that serious. And he even told me if it was me, I would not let it get to me! So, I told Freddie’s actions were way out of line. He said he had no proof and he had no prior complaints. Freddie added more to his story to cover his butt. So basically, I told him I was leaving his gym. He said, “Oh well, sorry but you have to do what you have to do.” Basically, I got no support from their core management at all. And they condone the activities of arrogant 20 something assistant managers! They do not care about service. They look at members as money. Once you join, they see $34.99 a month and that is it. They don’t make any money from you as far as a sale standpoint, so that is why they could care less. The main manager seemed very unsympathetic and he was texting while having a conversation. And he was rude towards my son at one point. It was weird to see the lack of customer service from these clowns! They don’t realize that word of mouth gets around and causes memberships to fall. They are getting paid next to nothing. And I really like those managers that say “I have been in this business for 17 years etc”. Wow, 17 years were wasted as a gym employee. It's not rocket science. You’re a jock that never stopped wanting to be a jock. And a monkey can do the job and has more customer service skills.In closing, don't join. If you do, you get what you pay for as far as service. And maybe we even pay too much at that! After that meeting, I went to UFC Gym and joined that. But I have no expectations, just to work out and that is it. And if they don’t treat me with some respect as member, I will leave and just work out on my own! So far, I have wasted three days on this, but I don’t see it so much as that I see it as making a point. I knew there was a reason I was not a gym member for some years and now I remember why! I had to pay for another gym membership elsewhere and still be charged for another month at LA Fitness. "
1382,31082,2010-07-17,,"Do not sign any personal training with La Fitness. Ever! I agreed to sign a contract of 1 year personal training with LaMarr ** of La Fitness Evanston branch (who later switched to the Oswego branch), on 12/15/2009 under one condition, as he proposed and promised, that I will pay my first month and have the first month (30 days) to decide if I wish to continue with the program for the remaining 11 months. It was agreed that the first month will be $150 and the remaining 11 month will be $100 each month. I contacted him on 12/28/2009, 13 days after my initial contract, to cancel it and not to continue with the program. Since it was in the 30 days period, he agreed and ensured me it was all set and said I can see my paper works when he is back from vacation. On 1/15/2010, I was charged $100. It was then that I figure out he didn't cancel my account, but ""freeze"" it temporarily without my consent (while I asked him to ""cancel"" it). At this time, LaMarr ** told me the ""30 days grace period"" already passed and I must continue with the program for the rest of the year (ya right! because he chose to not cancel within the 30 days when I called). I was not happy about this and particularly the $100 dollar charged on 1/15/2010 when I was not aware I was even enrolled in a program and had rights to the services provided. Consequently, LaMarr offered me a one ""free"" month with him to compensate his lies before I will have the right to decide on 3/15/2010 (the date when the account will be activated) to continue with the existing/any other program or not. He wrote the agreement on his name card that I can decide on 3/15/2010.Couple days before 3/15/2010, I did not wish to continue the 1 year program because of my planned relocation out of Evanston, IL. LaMarr, along with another female sales person, provided the information from ""the headquarter"" that I could pay the same rate ($100/month) for a 6 month program (instead of the 12 month) beginning 3/15/2010, terminating on 9/15/2010 (Aug 15 last bill). I agreed to the terms and condition described in the above sentence. However, every time I asked for any formal written document, he always had an excuse why I didn't need to worry, why it was all set and why I didn't need it, at least 3 different times. After awhile (months), you just give up on the paper work request part. He even laughed at me how much I care about my money. If he were to find a financial planner, that would be me. How rude was that?Today 7/15/2010, I found out from another salesperson that LaMarr didn't cancel my previous account (12 month program) and the ""6 month program"" did not even freaking exist in my account. They now require me to finish the one year program that I initially signed up for disregarding all the false promises since the beginning, including the two fake actions that LaMarr was supposed to take. Without a formal written document he ""refused"" to give, I am not able to show the crap to La Fitness headquarter. He was like ""oh no worries. I took care of that already. Let's work out now! "" and ""it was necessary for you to resign a new contract since I only have to change it and not establish a new account. "" LaMarr now denied everything he has said and done, and told me and other salespeople and managers entirely different stories (as if he has very serious amnesia), omitting the promises he made (private and public) and emphasizing the existing paper works that is advantageous to him. Hereby I am submitting this complain to reveal the false promises and unethical business practices of La Fitness, particularly Mr. LaMarr **.On 7/15/2010, when I complained to another manager, she told me and semi-laughed at me something like: ""If I were you, I would have requested a written document and have all the paper works ready in case there is one day like this. "" Are you kidding me? Right! He had millions excuses why I can't have my paper and his signature. Is it the clients' fault to trust the non-stop [lie[ you have been giving? I will fight this to the end and post another update later. PS. Needless to say, once you signed, they still charge you when LaMarr didn't show up for his appointment and the ""attentive"" service gradually faded away. For the sake of your mental health and bank account, stay away from La fitness."
1383,30823,2010-07-15,,"I purchased personal training from LA Fitness on 6/20/10 and an enrollment fee of $258.06 was charged on 6/21/10. The first monthly fee of $106.08 was charged on 7/2/10. The personal trainer was a no-show for the sessions scheduled on 6/24/10, 7/9/10, and 7/11/10. Their policy of 24-hours in advance cancellation notice was not honored by the personal trainer. Since the personal training services were not rendered, I requested a full refund of the enrollment fee, the first monthly fee, and cancellation of training without penalty. They then began giving me the run-around (telling me the manager can only authorize refunds, and the manager not being available when I called every hour-on-the-hour for 2 days). I finally called another location across town and explained my story, which prompted the manager from the original location to finally call me back. He was quick to tell me that cancellation with a full-refund is only granted within 3-days of signing the contract. I responded that this doesn't apply to my situation, as the problems started after this grace period. He then tried another tactic, saying the trainer I had signed up with was technically the training manager, and was not supposed to be offering individual training sessions. According to him, the last session was free as an apology for the no-shows. He then tried to get me to sign up with another trainer so I'd get all my sessions (that Id paid for) for the month. I responded with I don't care what it says on his job statement form. He signed me up with training sessions with him. He was a no-show on them, and there was no mention that these were free sessions, so I want my money back. Also, I told him if they hired a guy who would be a no-show for 3 sessions, what does that say about their hiring practices, and why would I want someone else who works there? Finally, the manager said he would send this complaint to corporate. Not trusting his word, I immediately called my credit card company, disputed the LA fitness charges, and canceled my credit card. Additionally, I reported LA Fitness to the BBB. I just received an email from LA Fitness detailing my full refunds without penalty, and I also called corporate to confirm the refunds, which they did."

I told him I wasn't going to sign up unless I knew they were able to deal with knee injuries and come up with appropriate exercises. He assured me he had someone that specialized in knee injuries.The first session, I did a bunch of random things like jumping jacks (not good for a knee injury I found out later). The second session was canceled because my personal trainer had ""personal issues"" he needed to attend to. The third session, the trainer again had me do a weight bearing exercise that I later found out was not appropriate for someone who had recent knee surgery.Then I lost my job. So I called to cancel the personal training, which I was told that I could do any time. Sure, I can do it anytime –but then I have to pay a penalty of $1800 to buy out of a contract I never entered into!They say they have my signature on a contract stating something about 11 payments of $360 a month. But the only thing I signed was the authorization for my credit card to be billed for the first month! But they then used that electronic signature to copy onto a contract that says I'm legally bound yaddah, yaddah, yaddah. Great. So I was bait and switched by someone that paid $59.95 to get a certificate that says he's a personal trainer and never had any specialized training!So then the trainer (Mario) tells me he will suspend my personal training for a month and give me time to ""figure things out.” He doesn't tell me there is an additional charge to suspend my account, but tells me to call back next month if I am still not working.So I called the next month and ""Mario"" doesn't work at the Saugus location anymore and this new kid Justin has taken over. Justin tells me he can suspend my account for another month, but it will be $15 per month. I tell him Mario didn't charge me last month, so why am I being charged now? He says I ""probably” was charged for last month and that there is nothing he can do about the fee. ""It's policy.""Now, I don't know what the hell to do. I want to cancel my account and walk away like everyone said I could do. I just wish I didn't get taken by these glorified third party sales reps they call ""personal trainers.""Now it seems that I am liable for $1800 even though I have no foreseeable way of paying this much money. I only wanted to sign up for two months and I got railroaded for 12. Physically, it’s another story. I went to my orthopedic doctor who told me I shouldn't be doing the exercises the trainer has me doing because it was causing more damage and not building muscle.

I spoke with the manager and he said I would be refunded the initial enrollment fee of $199.98 and sign me up on the city program. I contacted him 4 to 5 times with no avail. He finally referred to Derek who was very rude and said the promotion had expired and that after a week I could not get my refund. I told them I would file a complaint with Consumer Affairs, but they still did not resolve the issue. Fees were charged to my account at $199.98 plus monthly fees of $24.99 (the monthly fees are okay). I just don't want to pay for the enrollment fees of $199.98. Under the city program, the enrollment fee was $0 at the time with a monthly fee of $29.99, which I preferred. Antonio, the manager of the place, continued giving me the run-around.

We mailed in their crazy paper cancellation notice, received an email confirmation of our cancellation and then still got billed the following month! I understood our contract initial payment to include first and last months payments. so I still don't understand the extra billing cycle. The representative I talked to said that the cancellation had to be 10 days prior to the next billing cycle which we were beyond.

They would not let me cancel in person. There was one person there and she told me to look it up on the internet and send in a cancellation form. This is a frequent issue with LA Fitness. They are very accommodating when you want to sign up but make it almost impossible to cancel memberships. This is a consumer abuse that needs to end!

So I log onto the website and cancelled my membership through the website. Note that I have done this prior as I was a member roughly 2-3 years prior. They told me the last available date I could use the gym was 6/27/2010 on the website. Today, 6/26/2010, I received another monthly charge. I head over to LA Fitness and they said they never received anything from me about cancelling. I was told I had to fill out a form and mail it to corporate. I asked about the web site cancel-membership feature and they informed me. 'oh no, that doesn't work. you need to mail it in'. So, for basically the entire month of June, I was under the impression my membership was cancelled. Forgive me for thinking that it actually worked. This is so frustrating. I'm basically being robbed and ""there's nothing you can do about it"". The website alone is a hoax. It leads you into thinking the cancellation was final (why else would it tell you your end date) and all the while, they charge you another month of fees."

Ok, I never signed anything saying that I wanted personal training. I said “OK, we will see how the first session goes.” During the session he was not even focused on me; he was trying to rush me and get to new clientele. I felt like I was not being helped, so I never gave him the okay. Next thing you know money is coming out of my account and he said he would fix it and he did not. I am fighting them today. My checking account has consistently bounced."
1390,218221,2010-06-21,,"Much like others have reported, I signed up reluctantly to LA Fitness on a month to month. I was called to get my ""free"" training. I should have known from the start that this was going to end badly when they basically ordered me to meet with this person. I did so, and after a huge sales job by this person, I told him I did not want to get any training as I have been working out for years. He kept on and on and I finally agreed to once a month, someone would write up all of my work out routines and he said he would throw in some extra workouts due to the sign up fee, he forgot to mention! At that point, I unfortunately signed something, an agreement that he did not go over with me at all. Several cancelled appointments later (without even calling me), they put me with a trainer (not the guy who signed me up as stated). This twenty something year old proceeded to train me like a boy his age (I am a 48 year old female) and over trained me. Two months later, I am still being seen by a doctor for back problems. Both of my arms inside the elbow blew up the size of a softball and I could not straighten my arms for almost two weeks. After all this, do you think I want anyone in that place to ""train me""? no. But do you think you can get out of this ""agreement"" with them... also no. It was made clear to me that I will basically have to submit a complete write up, doctors notes and documentation and then they will send to the VP to review. This place is a scam and the number one goal is to get your money. I should have gone with my first instinct, to run. Medical injuries and an ongoing cost of $480."

My local hospital Harborview has this on file. I have never been forced to report it to the police with Harborview. LA Fitness requires it to cancel. The member told me he knew my schedule of when I came to swim, asked where I lived, what I did for a living, if I had sisters etc. I felt uncomfortable and did not want to return to the club. You would think that LA Fitness would allow me to cancel under such circumstances. They will not. My personal trainer (I told corporate it was not an employee, I made that clear) emailed me tonight telling me he's removing me from his schedule! After a Google search, I learned this is textbook protocol for their trainers to protect themselves! Unbelievable that the club would deny me the cancellation, pay the fee and require me to file with the police. Google this, many victims don't, due to the psychological effects it has on one's personal safety, and etc.I am going to be billed until Dec. 2010 for $219 a month without any support. LA Fitness does not take these reports seriously or into consideration. It does not matter if you are harassed, raped etc. in their clubs. They will still collect the money they need to continue to be a profitable business."
1392,218215,2010-06-17,,"Visited LA Fitness with the intention to get a membership for myself and my wife on 6/17/2010. I had visited previously to check out the new facility but decided not to join at time because we were satisfied with our gym we were using at the time. However, the other gym was a little too far from our home and cost more. So I decided to check LA Fitness again and quickly remember all the reasons I did not sign up. First off, they ask for your driver's license when you ask for rates, and put you in their database. Instead of giving you rates, they then call over a salesperson to give you a tour. At the conclusion of the tour, they sit you down at a desk and pull out a scrap piece of paper and tell you to sign up, you pay an initiation fee, plus first and last. I asked for rates again. They say, ""If the price is right, are you willing to sign up now"". I ask them again, ""What is the rate?"" They give me the same rehearsed line, ""if the price is right."" I had to look around to double check where at was at because I felt like I was working with a used car salesman. I finally replied, ""I asked you guys 2 times what the rates where and you still haven't given me an answer. At this point another salesperson, (maybe he was a manager), rudely interrupts and says, ""You look like a straight forward guy, just tell us if you're ready to sign up if we give you a good rate. I couldn't believe that they wouldn't give me a rate unless I cooperated with their used salesman tactics. I actually told them I felt like I was at a used car lot and told them to never mind- they were wasting my time. Needless to say, they lost 2 memberships that day with their sales tactics. "
1393,218219,2010-06-15,,"My husband and I were at the club on a Sunday afternoon. He bikes and then swims and I swim laps. We both do the hot tub and then go home. Sometimes we shower and sometimes not since we live literally 5 minutes from the club. The club is usually clean except for the carpet but many things seem to go wrong. The pool heater seems to always get broken and the hot tub is either too hot or not hot. This Sunday the pool was cold. I swim 20 laps or so after beginning; it was not too bad. While in the pool area, you cannot hear anything that goes on in the workout room. If there is a loud speaker in the pool area, I have never heard it. I decided to go ahead and shower since it was late in the afternoon before going home. I took off my suit in the shower and wrapped a towel around myself to go get my clothes. When I walked into the women's locker room, there was a man cleaning the sinks. I look surprised and asked him what he was doing. He kept on working and staring and said they announced it. I was rude and told him to get out until I was dressed. We heard nothing about men in the locker rooms while in the pool area. After dressing and as I walked out, I noticed that signs had been posted at the doorway stating that men would be working in the locker rooms. Those were not there when I entered and there was no sign at the entry from the pool area.I know that these jobs do not pay a great deal, but that just means that managers need to train staff. I complained to the two men on duty as I left, but they were not the managers and I don't expect anything will be done. I told them they should have a woman clear the locker rooms before any man goes in to work. I reminded them that with the hot tub going and while you are swimming, you cannot hear anything. No one came into the pool area and blew a whistle to let us all know. There were two other women in the pool area after I left. It is the management’s responsibility to see that these things are carried out. During the week, women clean the locker room.I believe what the other people who wrote complaints about LA Fitness is true. They are only interested in your money. The trainers are only kids with good bodies and they have no physical therapy degrees and should be avoided most of the time. Some are good, but you have to watch to see which ones they are. I was angry and wanted to post my feelings for the rest of you to see."
1394,218218,2010-06-15,,I would never return to such a disturbing place where the manager himself Luis is a sexual predator. Very unprofessional when he tries to make sexual advances. How does a place of such reputation hire people like this to represent their stores? If they are use to easy woman I am not a **.
1395,218217,2010-06-12,,"I belonged to a fitness club called Miekos and on June 1st, I received a letter that they had closed down on May 26th and my membership had been transferred to a completely different business in a completely different part of town. They said they would continue to bill me, but it would be LA Fitness. What the heck! So I called LA Fitness in Ballard and they said I had to come in to get an address to send a cancel form to. So I did that and sent it in with my old Miekos card and I just noticed they billed me. I keep calling and they will not give me a corporate number and I don't know what to do. I did not join their gym and I have no desire too, but they won't stop charging me. Don't you think that we should have had a choice to join a gym before they started billing me? My blood pressure has went up and I feel like I have been taken advantage of and that I don't know how to deal with crooks like LA Fitness. I run a company with over 2700 employees and you can bet I will get the word out. I'm also out the fee they just charged me."
1396,218216,2010-06-10,,"An L.A. Fitness Contract states that if you work more than 25 miles from the nearest facility, you cannot be held to your contract. I do and have provided proof. However, the gym still refuses to cancel my contract and continues to bill me monthly. I'm out $600 and a continuous $200 per month."
1397,218214,2010-06-04,,"The condition of the LA Fitness at Devonshire St., Northridge, CA 91324 is horrible. No one picks up weights. Dumbbells are left all over, plates are left on floor and machines. Even when you arrive at opening time, 4:30 am, these conditions exist. When trainers and help arrive, they stand around and do nothing. Once their trainers start, they even leave dumbbells on the other side of the gym, so members cannot find them or use them. They are some of the worst offenders, also leaving weights on all machines. Several machines are always broken, taking days to fix. The worst part is the general manager, Rick **. He has been informed by several members, and rather than addressing the issue, he works out and then goes home. It is a shame when the GM and corporate offices are informed, they still do nothing to show care or respect for existing members. I also tried on several occasions to discuss with the corporate office in California. They never pick up the phone. They leave you on hold. When you finally get them, they do nothing. Today (June 4, 2010), I spoke to Ryan in the corporate office. He assured me that executive vice president Lisa ** would be informed of the problems since the regional manager, and the actual gym manager do not care at all about the broken equipment, dirtiness of the gym, and the lack of care by staff to ensure that the weights are picked up off the floor and put back where they belong.Luckily, a brand new 24 Hour Fitness opened down the street. I know personally hundreds of people are already leaving for the new gym. I am also about to leave because after 2 more calls to corporate, 2 chats with onsite managers, and a talk with the GM, Rick **, there's not a single improvement. Again, if you are a member and want to also complain, here is the direct number. If things improve I will write back and let you all know. I tripped on the weights, and have torn my miniscus in the left knee."
1398,218213,2010-06-03,,"I actually worked for LA Fitness for a few months until I couldn't handle it anymore. So many people including people in my own family have gone through hell trying to quit or deactivate memberships with this awful company. The reason it's so hard is because of EFT or Electronic Fund Transfer. This is where a company gets the authorization to hit your credit card every month for a set amount. And this ladies and gentleman is the goose that laid the golden egg for LA Fitness. Once they get their claws onto your credit card, they will stop at nothing to keep grabbing your money and they make it very difficult to quit. This company is horrid and deplorable and has zero integrity whatsoever. The owners of this company truly don't give a crap about the public and integrity. They count on more and more people being duped into signing up and then basically taking their money every month and making it really hard to stop. I would tell anyone ever thinking about joining this club to not do it. The health club business is really sleazy. They start out when you want to join showing you really high prices and then try to show you their special promotions which will only last a day or two at most. Of course, they always are having special promos. I've heard people very high up in this company laugh about how they get people's money and make it so hard to quit. It's actually the company strategy. It's not an accident. This was a very well thought out method of maintaining the flow of EFT money. "
1399,218212,2010-06-02,,"I signed up for a membership with LA Fitness about 6 months ago mainly to access the racquetball courts. After about 3 months, I checked into adding a neighbor-friend who also played racquetball. I spoke to Michael who is in sales at the club and who originally signed me up. He said he could work a deal for me where my friend could pay about an extra $5/month if he paid about $100 down. Basically we would add him on as a family member wink. I thought sure, this is better than paying the $15 guest pass fee every time we play and as long as we play at least once a month (which is about what we play) it would be worth it over the long haul. So I signed up and kept what I thought was the extra $5/month on my card. A few months later I noticed that I was being double billed at my original rate plus the same rate plus $5. I think to myself, oh, I see what happened here, they made a mistake. I talked to the guys at the front desk since the manager wasn't there and they of course couldn't do anything so they said they would have a manager call me back. Josh the manager (who sounds and acts like he is 12) calls me back and I explain what happened. He responds that he would rebate me a month. I said Josh, you don't understand, did you talk to Michael and did he tell you the deal he gave us? He said, I looked at the contract and it says something different. Eventually I explained that I must have been deceived because why on earth would I pay an extra $35/month when I was only paying $29 when I'm adding a person who will only come once a month? He says he doesn't know but they don't have a membership for $5 month. I asked him to make this right and he kept going back to the one month. Again, I said you have an employee problem here in that both my friend and I believed that we were signing for an extra $5/month and your answer is to rebate me one month for one person when I've been double billed for 3 months. I warned him that I would quit if that was his answer and asked if it was worth losing a customer over $90 and he is said that was ok with him. So I go to cancel and see that cancelling is a colossal pain in the rear and that there is no customer service number at corporate to call on the website. There is no blog. There is no way to email anyone at the company. I then go to this website and see all of the nightmares folks have dealt with. My question is how does this company stay in business with service like this? They practice deceit and appear to only care about the next person they sign up."
1400,218211,2010-06-02,,I made a request that one of their 14 television monitors had Fox News. I was told that Corporate did not approve Fox News on any of their televisions since members of LA Fitness are liberal and do not want to view a conservation TV station.
1401,218210,2010-05-28,,"I saw an ad for LA Fitness ad in which a free 3 day trial to check out the gym was offered so, I decided to check it out. After a lengthy, prying and unusually invasive interview with a staff member I was given a short tour of the gym. Afterwards, I was led back to the sign-up desk and in a manner befitting a cult brainwash technique was bullied in an attempt to force me to immediately sign up for membership. When I resisted and asked to be able to just check out the gym for a few hours, reminding them with an analogy of test driving a car before actually buying it, the general manager went into an attempted humiliation technique by suggesting that I since I'd just come in for a ""freebie"" he could throw me a day pass! I've been residing in Tokyo, Japan for almost 10 years now as a working actor. I also keep a residence in Manhattan, NY, as well as, Venice, CA. I've lived and traveled in over 50 countries over the past 25 years. I came into LA Fitness with my most polite demeanor and Japanese-like manners. I was treated horrendously and disrespected worse than I have been anywhere in my entire adult life. The fact of the matter is that I was indeed coming in with full intention to join! I plan on residing in Seattle on and off for the next few years to take care of my aging mother. How foolish of that degenerate staff member and general manager! If anyone from LA Fitness reads this beware! You have a beautiful club. But, the staff needs some serious shaking up!"
1402,218208,2010-05-20,,"I have membership for LA Fitness. A personnel approached for personal training and convinced to sign up for a year. He confirmed that I can cancel that anytime if I don't like it. I did so, after 6 months paying every month 120 dollar (no result on my body though). I requested to cancel my personal training membership, they said we can not cancel now and needs to be completed one year. He advised me to put my account frozen for the remaining 6 months (each month costs $15), then I can cancel. After 6 months, finally I went to local LA Fitness yesterday to cancel the trainer membership. Now they are saying ""you have to continue for the remaining 6 months or pay half of 6 months' pay and cancel it"". This is totally ridiculous and unacceptable. They are trying to milk as much as possible. I paid first six months 6 x $120 = $720. I kind of agree with what they charged for. Half of 6 months fee is 6 x $60 = $360. Account frozen fee $90, total $450. Is there anyone to help me?"
1403,218209,2010-05-19,,"After we signed up, then this personal trainer that gave us a free session started talking to us to sign up for his training session and how important it was for us, then he kept on pressuring us and talking us into it until we fell in the trap! Finally after an hour of talking to us, he convinced us and he said, it is only one time payment of $150.00 and finally we put that on our credit card and walked out. It was only until yesterday, 5/18/2010, when we found out that they (LA Fitness) are still withdrawing $100.00 from out bank account monthly fee since the above mentioned date, so then I immediately went to the location and confronted them about it, and all they did printed a piece of paper and said here this is a contract that you signed. **, how did our information go on a contract and how did a last name only signature go on that piece of paper, how come we did not sign any contract at that time when Chris withdrew $150.00 from our account! How did this happen, even if there was a contract or agreement, how come we did not get a copy of it at that time? What a scam, ripping people off electronically! Now, they told me to talk to the corporate office and after a long time of waiting. Finally, I spoke with supposedly a customer relations manager and all she said we signed a contract and I explained to her that we did not, and she said there is signature. Of course, with today’s technology, businesses and corporations are doing anything they desire to rip off innocent people like ourselves and now we have a contract we were unaware of and did not sign! Are you kidding me? It took the guy along time to finally convince us to pay him a onetime payment of $150.00. Do you think if we had known there was a contract, then we would've still sat there and singed it? It is bad enough one of us is not working and we are having a hard time surviving on a very tight budget."

1405,218206,2010-05-18,,"I have been a LA Fitness member since February of 2001. I have never really had any issues with my membership throughout all of this time because I never cancelled or even made changes, other than the normal contact information as it changed or account billing as necessary. Within the last couple of months, I was calling repetitively the Mary Brickell Village location in Miami, to inquire about the opening date since this location was going to be the most convenient for me with distance and to avoid traffic after work each day. In the beginning, I advised that I had been a member since 2001 and inquired whether my membership was going to be valid at this location because it was going to be a so-called signature location. The representatives always told me that my membership was okay to attend this location because of the amount of years I had been with LA Fitness. Of course, I was happy about this because I wasn't going to be paying more money for the convenience. Then within the past month, my boyfriend and I decided to start working out together. I then suggested to him, to add him to my account as a user so that he can also attend LA Fitness with me and also because the new location was literally five minutes from his house. My boyfriend thought that it was a great idea so I contacted one of the local locations and inquired about adding him to my account. I contacted the Cutler Bay location and spoke with one of the representatives there and advised of the situation. I advised my membership status, all the locations I had attended throughout my membership, and I even advised of the location I was currently going to, until the opening of the Mary Brickell Village location. I then asked him to add my boyfriend to my account. The representative advised that they are no longer adding individuals to already existing accounts and that a new account would have to be established for him. I complained about it, when in the past I had always heard of people having one account with multiple users. To cut me a break because I was complaining, they waived the initiation fee and just charged me $39.99 a month for my boyfriend's membership, not to mention that they charged two months up front to payment choice. So, I didn't think it was too bad of a deal and was happy that my boyfriend was going to be able to start working out with me and then starting the new location with me. Yesterday, May 17th 2010, I contacted the Mary Brickell Village location and was advised that they were open for business. My boyfriend and I decided to head over and try out the new gym and see what it was all about since they stated that it was a signature location and a more upscale location to the rest. We arrived at the gym and I gave my key tag; everything went fine, then my boyfriend gives his. To my surprise, he was advised that he cannot attend that location because he has a regular membership and for him to attend that location, he needs to upgrade his membership. I was surprised and advised the front desk representative that the representative who established his membership for me, did not advise me of this and failed to disclose that to me, not to mention that I had been a member for nine years. The representative advised that I contact the representative who established the account and see what they can work out for me. My boyfriend was upset and figured that there was something fishy about the whole thing and didn't think it was that easy. So I contacted the representative who assisted me and I explained my concern and discomfort for the situation and advised that yes, my boyfriend can go to any LA Fitness location with his membership, except, Mary Brickell Village, because it is a signature location. I explained to him that he never told me I needed to pay additional fees for his membership to attend this location, even after I advised that I was waiting for the opening of the Mary Brickell Village location and he insisted that I advised that I was attending the South Miami location, which I know is inaccurate. Well, after the conversation going back and forth and me requesting some of kind of deal or compensation for this inconvenience of misrepresentation, there was nothing else he could do and my boyfriend would have to upgrade his membership by paying $117 for the initiation fee and an additional $10.70 a month for the membership to use that location as well. My boyfriend was not happy with the result because of the misrepresentation of information and felt as if we were lied to, just to sell a membership, and then get more money from us later on. So, I had no choice but to agree to an upgrade and advised him to upgrade the account. He started working on the computer, then advising me that he couldn't do it over the phone and to just get someone at the Mary Brickell Village to assist me in upgrading my account. I was bothered by that because first, they can't add a member to my account, then they misrepresent or fail to mention the issue with the signature location and upgrading fees, then causing me an inconvenience at the location to find out about the membership issue, to then not assisting me with the inconvenience in some form, to now advising me that they cannot assist me with an upgrade over the phone. I just honestly could not believe the situation I was under, when I never had issues with this gym membership before in the last nine years with them. So, since the gym was recently opened and the entrance was crowded, we just basically went inside and started to workout. While my boyfriend worked out, I took upon myself to talking to one of the representative at the location to see if maybe after explaining the situation, they can assist me. I was wrong! Even though the representative was very nice to me, he simply couldn't do anything for me with the fees/upgrade, etc. no matter how much I was inconvenienced. So I ended up having to pay the $117 upgrade fee and bump the membership now to $49.99 a month for my boyfriend. I was upset, but did it anyway. So after I upgraded the membership, I took upon myself to walk around the location and see what the hype was about and why they are charging so much more and why they are considering it a signature location. Well, what a disappointment and a shame to be honest with them. The Mary Brickell Village does not have full amenities as in the other so-called regular locations. The location is smaller, there is no pool, no steam room, no jacuzzi and not that many aerobic rooms. This location has just focused mainly on cardio machines, free weights and weight machines, not to mention the gym isn't even called LA Fitness, it is called Esporta. After doing a tour, I was even more upset because how can they call it a signature location and charge more money, when that gym doesn't even compare to the other regular locations in amenities? I am completely and totally bothered and upset about this whole situation because I feel that they are riding on the location of the new gym because of the convenience of the working people in the area. True, I am lucky with my membership because they aren't charging me more money for the inconvenience, but they are completely taking advantage of the rest of the people who have either recently become new members, so they can't ""grandfather"" over to that location, or simply new walk-in members, when their location isn't as big or as full in amenities as the rest. I want to be able to talk to someone in corporate about this whole situation and see what can be resolved to relieve some of the inconvenience I have come across with this whole thing. After reading several postings, it doesn't seem as if that may be easy at all. I tried and see contact information on their website, but they always want to direct you to their local gym for assistance. Those facilities have a goal and that is to sell as many memberships as possible, so that they aren't going to cut too much of a deal for you, if at all. I just want some assistance and suggestions."

1408,218203,2010-05-10,,"A couple of months back, I was looking for fitness centers near my place in Lakeville, Long Island and I went to the local LA Fitness center. The attitude of LA Fitness sales manager Deodra was 'cut to the chase' who didn't really care about my needs. I was looking at a few alternatives and was researching which fitness center was most suitable both financially and aesthetically since I needed day care. She just gave me the prices and seemed ignorant as to whether or not I join. Since I really liked the facilities, I requested her to include child care in my monthly fee of $50. After 40 minutes of conversation over prices, finally she spoke to her coworker and agreed on my requested price. However, with that kind of service, I was reluctant to join and still wanted to check out other fitness centers and see if I like them better. This mothers' day, after about three months, my husband surprised me by giving me a membership of LA Fitness as mothers' day gift, which was $50 without child care. I went there with my husband and two kids to sign up and to request if they can give me the same price as they have previously. Unfortunately, this time, I was dealing with the same sales manager Deodra and she told us that she couldn't. When I reminded her about our conversation a few months ago, she said that at the time, they were running a promotion.I tried to remind her a few times that it wasn't any promotion they were running, they had lowered the price arbitrarily. She was stuck with the same misrepresentation that they had lowered the price three months ago because of a promotion. Then, I asked, if that was a promotion, why did I have to spend 40 minutes of my time and get her coworker's approval to have child care ($10) included in my membership fee? She couldn't answer that and kept to her original point of LA's having a special promotion three months ago and got very offended when I pointed to her how she was misrepresenting the fact. She was more eager to have us cancel than to try to accommodate in any way. So that's what we did--canceled the membership. That sales manager ruined my mothers' day gift and my respect for LA fitness."
1409,218202,2010-05-08,,"We signed up for a family membership, including my then 16 year old daughter, who has autism and other disabilities. She had staff who worked with her about 20 hours/week and exercise was one of the goals in her service plan. She would not be able to use the gym without trained staff. I am physically disabled and not able to help her. When we signed up, we asked about her staff attending with her. We were told that they would not need a membership. Later, when she and her maid attempted to use the gym, they were turned away because the maid did not have a membership. I called and left several voicemails for the manager. I left messages in person but I never received any response. As a physically disabled person, it wasn't very accessible nor did I feel welcomed at all. I spent $200 with nothing to show for it but mostly I am angry that we were never acknowledged and that LA Fitness isn't accessible to disabled people."
1410,218201,2010-05-07,,"I signed up for a membership before the club opened. I was told the new facility would have 2 rooms, with several classes taking place throughout the day in both rooms. I was also told the club would open the next day. The club did not open for about 2 weeks, and they almost had no classes for the next month. The gym was packed during heavy work out times as well. I asked for my money back and was denied. The manager said they would be adding more classes, they told me that over a month ago when I first complained, and nothing was done. They blame the problem on their inability to find a certified trainer to teach the class - but I doubt this is the case in Miami - especially in this economy. It doesn't take 3 months to hire personnel that is certified. I was given the form to send in and did, but I have not been given verification of cancellation or a return of my money. I am very dissatisfied. I paid about $150 initiation and am paying $30 per month for something that is not even available for me to use the way I was told I could use it. "
1411,218200,2010-05-06,,"I was referred by my father to join the LA Fitness Personal Training Session in Roseville, MN. I went in with my father and saw a personal trainer, Pete. After the free consultation, he asked that I signed a contract so we could get started. I hesitated and did not want to sign, but he kept on insisting that I have nothing to lose. He stated I can cancel if I changed my mind. He also said he will call me every week as a reminder to motivate me to attend my session. Two days after I signed up, I went back with my mom and dad to work out and also to cancel my personal training membership. My father and I went back to talk to Pete. I informed him I wanted to cancel my personal training membership. He kept on insisting I stay on for a few more days. He wants to work personally with me. I told him I did not have time as I am a full-time student and work almost full time. Pete excused himself and brought in Danny **, Personal Training General Manager. Danny asked why I wanted to cancel. I told him the same thing as I really did not think I would have the time. Danny insisted I stay in for at least a few more days to work out with Pete before I cancel. He refused to let me cancel and kept on insisting one after another. My dad also told him to cancel, but Danny thought if I gave it a few more days, I can make a better decision. I left the facility. Pete called and left a message for me the next Tuesday to go in for personal training. I was still working and in school so I could not make it. My dad went in to talk to Danny to cancel my account, but Danny brushed him aside saying he cannot talk to my dad as it is not his contract. I went in with my dad two weeks after to cancel again. Danny said he would have to contact corporate to get an okay to cancel since it’s been close to a month. I left my phone number with him and left. Three weeks went by and no phone calls from Danny. I sent Danny a certified letter with return receipt asking him to contact me about the matter. The return receipt came back and signed by LA Fitness. Two weeks went by with no response from Danny. My dad went to the gym and spoke to the Sales Manager to have Danny act on the issue and to ask for who the area or district manager was. The sales manager said he was the guy who takes care of everything in the club and refused to give my dad other key contacts. However, Danny called my dad the next morning and informed my dad he has been busy and forgot to call. Danny said since it’s been a long time now, I cannot cancel. There are options such as early cancellation fee. My dad asked him to send a letter to me listing all the options. It’s been almost four (4) weeks now and no answer from Danny. I was frustrated and upset, but it seems my dad is even more upset than I am as Danny ** lied time after time about this issue with excuses after excuses. It’s clear now about LA Fitness. Once you sign any contract at all with them, there is no way to cancel. They will not let you cancel. They will stall and use tactics to ensure you cannot cancel. There are five (5) of us with membership to LA Fitness, me, my dad, my mom, my aunt, and my uncle. My church is about one mile away from LA Fitness and we have about twenty-three (23) other members at the same LA Fitness in Roseville, MN. My dad has spoken to our pastor about LA Fitness and our experience there. My pastor said he will inform all the other members. In addition, we have a church of about 600 members. It will be just a matter of time before my dad talks to all the other ushers and elders in the church. LA Fitness is your worst nightmare. Do not sign up with them. As you can see, there are hundreds and hundreds of other complaints nationwide. I am currently paying $160/month which is withdrawn from my account on 4th of every month. In addition, I also paid them $140 initiation fee. It’s been five (5) months now and I have paid a total of $800 for my monthly's. Add $140 initiation fee and I have paid a total of $940 in five months. A total rip-off. Do yourself a favor and go to other health clubs. See Lifetime Fitness, Bally's, and Snap Fitness!"
1412,218199,2010-05-05,,"The week of the 15th in February 2010, I received a cancellation form from them to mail to their corporate office (they would not let me cancel in person). I mailed it in. They never canceled. I called today (5/5/10) and they offered to cancel it right away (over the phone, I may have talked to the same people who wouldn't let me cancel in person) but not to refund the misappropriated money. On record they would see that my account had not been used to access any facilities."
1413,218198,2010-05-05,,"I was injured at one of their facilities in Round Lake, Illinois. I signed up for a membership to have a personal trainer work with me once a week. After the second visit, I was working with a trainer named Rachael. I expressed to Rachael that I recently had surgery, my gall bladder removed and that I was having pain, I was told the pain I am experiencing is probably because I have not worked those muscles in a very long time. I am 49-year old woman about 50 lbs. overweight. She pushed me and thought she knew what she was talking about. Of course, she is qualified to work with me. She is a personal trainer or so I thought. I asked her 30 minutes into the training where she went to school she advised me she took a six-month course and became certified. In the meanwhile, my back was in great pain as well as the incision site. I went home and felt the burn, so to speak. Well, the burn did not go away. Two weeks later and two prescriptions for Vicodin and a shot of Cortizone in my lower back, I am still in pain. I submitted a note from my doctor to discontinue the personal trainer portion but I could continue cardio at a later date. My back is still in pain. I can't sit too long or stand in one place too long but this is the letter I received back from LA Fitness Corporate Office as to why they will not cancel my membership.""This confirms that your personal training membership will be cancelled once the initial term you agreed upon is completed. If at any time between today and your final billing date you opt to freeze your membership, the initial term of your personal training service agreement will be extended by the length of the freeze period. Following the end of the freeze period, your regular monthly dues will be charged to your account on file with us, pursuant to the authorization you previously provided, until completion of your initial term.""If you are still within the term of your personal training membership and sent a letter to cancel your contract early with payments still due and owing, your contract allows you to cancel early only if you provide specific supporting and verifiable documents which we have not received (please review page 2 of your contract). However, your contract does allow you the option to voluntarily cancel for any reason by paying a fee equal to 50% of the remaining contract balance. Your local club can give you the exact amount and collect the fee from you in person; otherwise, the monthly installments will continue to be billed. We hope this helps you make a decision. ""I can use any help you can provide."
1414,218197,2010-05-04,,You cannot go in and cancel for membership in a timely manner. They take your money fast enough but when you want to cancel I have wait for 10 days and do a mail form. I did not have to do this when I joined.
1415,218196,2010-05-03,,"I tried to cancel my membership with LA Fitness early March 2010, but because of their overcomplicated membership cancellation policy, I pay until June 10th. Here is the sequence of events in brief: March, 2010: Called Local LA Fitness Center, they said go cancel online or pick up the form March, 2010: Tried to cancel online, the date of cancellation shown is June 10th March, 2010: Called LA Fitness, they say this is not true! March, 2010: Picked up the form from local center; they say send it prior to billing date April 10 and you will be okay. April 4, 2010: Form completed and mailed. April 8, 2010: Received email from LA Fitness stating that service will be canceled June 8.May 3, 2010: Called LA Fitness spoke with rep James Fox inquiring why it is still June 8, I was trying to cancel in March? Besides, they already charged me last month payment when I joined the LA Fitness. James F suggested last month charge is not refundable and everything is in accordance to policies.I requested supervisor. James F said he is the supervisor. Requested a manager; again that is James F. To whom I can contact and complain? James F says to me, but there will be no refunds. LA Fitness cancellation policies designed to be overcomplicated to rob the customers and make them pay for services they no longer need and that are no longer provided. I was overcharged 3 months for services that I did not need requested, was trying to cancel and could not."
1416,218195,2010-04-29,,"I joined LA Fitness with a monthly membership of $44.99 at a promotion time when it is a signature club. After a week, I received a letter from LA Fitness corporation in CA telling me that my membership was downgraded to $34.99 due to the club will be downgraded from signature to a regular club. A month after, I heard many new membership talking about the fee being reduced to $24.99. I talked to an LA Fitness employee, he checked my contract and told me that I still have a super member price of $34.99 so I can have free towel and use courts. Unless I do not want these two services, then my fee will be dropped to $24.99. I don't need towel and use any court. So he changed something in his computer and then told me I am set for a price of $24.99 in the next month's bill. On the next day, I asked the same employee to give me a copy of contract. He told me that he checked my record again, and my existing account is not a super member, so I do not have access to towel and court. Therefore, my price is confirmed with $34.99. I was so disappointed. Two employees in this place that I deal with, are both telling me a lie. You cannot trust these people. I want everyone to know about this place. Think twice before joining this club if you do not want to be ripped off. "
1417,218194,2010-04-28,,"When I joined LA Fitness, it was for the purpose of becoming a member only. I was told that they would show me how to use the equipment without charge which they never did. When I requested this, I was told I needed personal training. I told them I could not afford personal training. Jeff, who is no longer with the company, pushed and pressured me. He said that I could try it for a month and if I didn't want to continue, I could cancel. I had the money for one month so I thought I would do it just for one month. I knew I wouldn't have money for this in the future. When I tried to cancel, Jeff lied to me and told me that I could put this training on hold and not pay anything until I could afford it. It was only later that I found out I would have to pay $15.00 a month to keep it on hold and by that time it was too late to cancel something that I never agreed to in the first place. I called the corporate office on Michelson Dr. to cancel my training. I told them the whole story. They said I had a binding ""contract"" and it could not be cancelled. I told them I never signed a contract for personal training and therefore, had no contract. When I asked them to produce this ""contract"", they referred me to the operations manager at my branch. She gave me a ""contract"" that I had never seen before, with a signature that had been transposed from an electronic pad which I used for my membership only. This is misrepresentation at the point of sale. I've been advised by a Judge who is a friend, that this is fraudulent and not my signature. When I spoke to LA Fitness about this, they said they would put my membership on hold for 6 months and not charge me. After 6 months, they began charging my credit card again. The only way I could get them to stop was by cancelling my card. Now, it's on my credit record that I'm not paying them money that I ""owe"" them.Now, I need LA Fitness to recognize that I have no contract for personal training, to make this null and void and to contact the major credit reporting agencies to erase this negative record. I've spoken with them numerous times but to no avail. I want them to refund the money they charged me since I did not use the training."
1418,218193,2010-04-26,,"Today, April 26, at LA Fitness on Fremont in Alhambra, CA, the water aerobics class coach was a no-show. Thirty minutes after inquiring at the desk, the desk clerk explained that the coach wasn't aware of the schedule. We learned from the clerk that the manager, Monique ** usually arrives about 10 am if we have a question. I cannot imagine how a business where the human body is stressed can operate safely without a manager or supervisor onsite during business hours. Management by phone is, in my view, an unacceptable manner to operate any business let alone where emergency situations could occur. Bottom line, LA Fitness customers should know there is no manager present in the morning. It appears that customers (members) are ""on their own"" when it comes to handling emergency or urgent situations. "
1419,218192,2010-04-18,,"My locker was robbed while I was working out. The perpetrator just took all my paper cash, leaving all credit cards, thankfully. But I would like the company to look into who was in the club during that time interval and see if any names match when others were robbed in the same fashion. I spoke with other members who said the same exact thing (modus operandi) happened to them. I lost between $75-$85."
1420,218191,2010-04-16,,"I joined LA Fitness in November 2009. I joined both the gym and entered into a personal training contract for one year. At the time, I told the personal trainer that there was a possibility that I would be moving from my then address approximately one mile from the gym to Palos Verdes (30 miles south) and if that were to happen, I could not keep my personal trainer. I told him that there would not be time for me to go to the gym. I was told by Roman that was not a problem. If I moved away from my current address, I could cancel both memberships without any problem. In January, I became engaged and knew I would be moving to Palos Verdes. I went into the gym and cancelled my gym membership and was assured that if I called the corporate office, I could cancel the personal trainer contract as they has promised at the time I signed up. My gym membership was cancelled immediately, and I was told by Jason ** at the corporate office that if I showed him proof of my new address, he would cancel my trainer membership and suspended my payments.I just received my new car insurance, faxed it to the corporate office and was contacted by Alicia who told me if I lived within 25 miles of LA Fitness, no matter where it was, they would not cancel my contract. This was contrary to everything I had been told from the very beginning. They just withdrew money from my checking account for the month of April. I no longer have my gym membership, was assured that the personal trainer membership would be terminated by two people and they are deducting money and have changed everything they told me.I have been deceived and lied to by LA Fitness. Their attitude is, ""we understand, but too bad."" Why would I cancel my gym membership if I had to keep the training contract? I was told at the time that both contracts would be cancelled. When I tried to call the corporate office, I was given to a bank of telephone people who couldn't have cared less about my situation. This is an unfair practice. Each person you speak with promises and assures you something different. As I read through all of the complaints, I am very aware that this seems to be a typical mode of operation and completely unacceptable."
1421,218190,2010-04-15,,"Not easy to cancel membership. I have to pay an extra 2 months. The gym is dirty and members do not like to let you work-in, they leave their bags and equipment on floors, sit on stairs and are not required to have towels so there really is no one to look after the dirty equipment. Basically I talked to them 2 times about rules and they said they can't even post them. I have only started the process but I can tell that they are out 3 memberships because my friends, including me, are going to another gym where rules do matter. They'll be out $6300.00 in the next five years because of their bad business. "
1422,218189,2010-04-13,,"Trying to cancel a membership with LA Fitness is like a bad joke. Not only can you not cancel at the location you signed up at, you have to send your cancellation request via certified or registered mail (Otherwise they will claim that they never received it). I followed these procedures to cancel my membership as well as the additional monthly fee for childcare. I also sent a cancellation request for both on their website where you can access your account. They actually cancelled my membership but didn't cancel the childcare when I called the corporate location to ask what part of my letter and online correspondence was unclear, the rep asked if I sent in 2 letters, one for each request.Of course not, I replied, why would I waste 2 pieces of paper when it fit easily on one? He said, well, that's the problem, you have to send in a separate request for each one. He also informed me that he cannot go look at my letter to verify my request because they don't keep them. I finally got him to cancel the childcare while I had him on the phone and to send me an email, so I had something in writing but he refused to credit back the final payment for the childcare. What good does the childcare do me for another month when my membership is cancelled? What a scam!"
1423,218188,2010-04-10,,"I was approached by John outside of a strip plaza where I had been shopping and he invited my husband and me to a free week at the gym to see if it would be something that we would be interested in. We set up an appointment for a Monday at 6:30 p.m. We showed up on time and were told by the young lady at the desk that he would be with us. We waited for 15 minutes and he never showed up. So at this point we told the young lady that we would be leaving and that I did not much care for the way that you did business. No one told us that he was with another client, or would we like to have someone else help us or even if we would like to tour the facilities to see what it was like. So we figured that you really did not want our business. John calls the next to apologize and asked if we would give him another chance to make it up. So we did, and we set the appointment for the Thursday, which I had to call and cancel as I had an unexpected issue that I had to take care of. At which he said he would schedule for the following Friday which we did. He even called us on that day to remind us of the appointment. We showed up on time only to find out that he had already left for the day. At that point I really did not care who took care of us. I am not used to doing business that way. Your company seems to hire personnel that only care about their pay check and not about the customer. You obviously do not have your prospective client’s interest at heart. Maybe corporate should make a visit down here and see what it rally is like. Or maybe that is how you do business."
1424,218187,2010-04-09,,"I joined LA Fitness Club in March of last year. I used for one month and I could not be frequent so I asked to cancel. It was in the contract that I could cancel any time. The manager told me I could not cancel my membership there and gave me a form to cancel mailing it to CA. I did that and went back to the club to see if everything was okay. He said it was done right. Yesterday, I noticed in my credit card statement that they have been charging me since then. (Never stopped charging). I called the center in CA and they told me they never received the form. They make things difficult for people to cancel, not allowing cancellations in the center we registered in first place. Then, they say they never received the cancellation form. The manager even told me it was okay and my membership had been cancelled. What should I do? I also called my credit card company and told them to dispute the charges and stop any future payments. When I talked to LA Fitness yesterday by phone, Ryan said he was cancelling the membership to make sure no more charges would happen. Please help me to get rid of these people. I haven't been to this place for a year! $34.99 times 12 months = approx $419.88 charged after cancellation. Thanks."
1425,218186,2010-04-09,,"I am so glad I researched LA Fitness before joining! Thank you all for your feedback; you saved me a lot of headaches. The reason I researched it was that a mailing was sent to me to try it out and cost was the first thing on my mind. I called the 877 number and had automatic response. I did not like that but I thought to continue the call anyway. I was asked to press 1 for the location I wanted. The phone rang forever, then someone unprofessional and with a monotone voice answers. My question was, ""Could you tell me how much is the membership?"" He said just a moment and left me on hold forever. I hung up. I called to another location and the same thing happened. I then was intrigued by the process and decided to research this outfit on the net. Thank God I did. I want to have fun and be fit not to aggravate myself needlessly. Good luck in the future!"
1426,218185,2010-04-09,,"I worked for LA Fitness for about a month. In that month, I found that this company is unethical. Working in the front desk, one of the primary jobs was doing clear-ups. A clear-up is to get back dues and get a card/account number. I did not mind this. But I was soon told that if a client thought they cancelled, ask how. Then tell them how to cancel and it has to be certified mail. I was told that if it isn't certified, the company then can say ""it was lost in the mail"". Our official response was to say this. Even though it was known that it probably was thrown away. When you sign up, you may be double charged at first and that can lead to a lot of money. When you sign up, you have to pay a fee. First and last month dues but if the computer froze or if the sales rep hits the send button twice, you can be charged twice. It takes a week to reverse this charge. Also, got kids? Kids Klub is sometimes filled (in my location) over the number of kids allowed by state. Worse yet, many of the girls have said that they were the only one for 20+ kids (Oregon law is one care person = 10 kids). Also, I was told since I was a female, I would have to sub in because the males do not do Kids Klub. Corporate took away the copier and fax machine so now, the software to scan people a copy of their contracts cannot be printed. Unless you have an email address, you will not get a copy.So I left and cancelled my membership (I was a member beforehand). It took 15 days. I wrote comments about how unethical the company was and when I went to get my last paycheck, the manager questioned me about it. She denied that she ever told me that the cancellation forms get lost in the mail. I could not believe her flat-out lie because while working there, she told me at least on 2 occasions. It hurts people's credit and their trust."
1427,218184,2010-04-08,,"I was on a seven-day pass that I printed up online. Everything was alright and going good, until I entered the locker room. It was the nastiest sight I had ever seen. There was feces and blood all over the toilets, bloody tampons stuffed into a little white box and some on the floor as well. The showers were very stained and had hair, and God knows what else on the floor of it. The carpet looked worst than the carpet you would find in most low-budget motels, and the whole changing area smelled of mildew and feet. I quickly left out of the locker room as fast as I could and went in the pool area, and that was also a sight for sore eyes as well. The stains on the inside of the pool looked like something at a public park. It was awful. I couldn't believe people were paying money to use this facility. On my way back through the locker room, I came across a team member showing another female the ''amenities'' of the club. I couldn't believe they were showing people that and they were still choosing to workout here! As I exited the locker room area, I ran into another employee; and I asked him what he did for LA Fitness. He said, ''I'm the lead janitor.'' And I felt that maybe he wasn't aware of the mess in the locker room, so I described to him what I saw. I was shocked at his reply; he replied, ''Ma'am, I'm sorry about that, but our female janitor doesn't get here for a few more hours or so.'' Needless to say, after talking with him, I decided that to finish the rest of my pass, I should attend only at night when they had adequate staff to clean up behind such people.The next night, I got there at around 7pm, and true enough, it was a little cleaner and in the process of being cleaned by the female janitor who he obviously was referring to. As the night progressed, the more I witnessed that young woman (as she looked only 20 years old) cleaned and cleaned. 5 minutes after she was out the door, no doubt onto her next duties, the women would continue making a mess and deliberately tossing things everywhere. Later that night, I even observed another guest yelling at the young woman demanding that she stopped cleaning the showers and let her get in the shower. I felt bad when the young woman just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders as if to say ""Okay, have it your way."" It seems outrageous, but it is true. The women were actually stopping her from cleaning those filthy showers!When I thought of going back to L.A. Fitness at any one of their locations, I thought of how nasty it was, and I decided to join another club somewhere else. I couldn't belong to a club that would allow its members to stop a employee from cleaning and would have a period in the day where there was no one to clean at all.''LA Fitness is dedicated to making your workout experience an exceptional one.'' Mine was very exceptional and unique, so much until I never wanted to return there again and never have. So all you who are thinking about joining, then think twice because it very nasty and might even be unsafe. Who knows?"
1428,218183,2010-04-08,,"On Tuesday, April 6th, 2010, I filled an incident report at L.A. Fitness, Marcus Ave. New Hyde Park, NY 11042. My gym locker was broken into and my platinum wedding band and Breitling Navitimer watch were stolen. This happened within a 30 minute window of time. I noticed the theft at exactly 4:35 pmAfter arriving at the gym, I entered the first men' s locker room. Changed my clothes and used locker number 134. I had placed my wedding band and watch into an inside, zippered compartment of my gym bag. I locked my locker. When I returned to my locker about a half an hour later, I found my locker wide open and my gym bag was open on the floor. My Platinum wedding band valued at $1,000.00 and Breitling Navitimer watch valued at $5,000.00 were both missing. I went straight to the front desk and asked Jennifer S. to call the police for me. Officer C. of the 3rd Precinct, arrived shortly after. He took my information for case number 210CR0027910. He told me that he has been coming to this particular L.A. Fitness very often for the past few weeks for the same kind of incidents. High value watches and jewelry regularly being reported stolen. So regularly that while I was completing my report with office C., another gym member was waiting to file his report for a missing Rolex and cash.After completing my police report, I filed an incident report with Jennifer S. at the front desk. Report attached. I was told that the gym is not liable for missing belongings. She also admitted that the gym knew about the problem but she did not state any action being taken to correct it.Later that evening, I received a call from a detective with the 3rd Precinct to review my report. I was advised that the police have been dealing with a lot of reports filled at this L.A.Fitness and that the gym is claiming complete deniability and will not take any responsibility. This gym does not even have any cameras. They know about the problem and honestly don't care. I have already placed an official complaint with the Better Business Bureau, Fox News, and NBC News. I cancelled my membership because I do not feel safe at this gym. I lost approx $6,000.00 worth of jewelry. I am terribly hurt that my wedding band is gone. that can never be replace. "
1429,218182,2010-04-08,,"I have never felt more welcome at a gym in my life! I love LA Fitness! The staff is very friendly and I am always greeted with a hello upon entering. I love that there isn't a contract too. Whenever I go to the gym, I never have to wait for a machine and it is always immaculately clean! Zak **, the general manager and Uriel ** have been such a big help to my fitness. Thank you so much!"
1430,218181,2010-04-01,,"I canceled my account in the middle of February online and by mail. They informed me because of the time period, they would still charge March's balance to my card but that would be the last. It's April and my bank just notified me that LA Fitness has charged the monthly fee again, after they said they would charge past March. I just got off the phone with the branch where I opened my account. They said that even though I canceled online that I would have to notify them in writing. I said I did, I mailed my cancellation. She said ""did you send it certified?"" Certified! If you have to cancel with LA Fitness you can do it online, can do it by phone and you can mail it but if you don't mail the cancellation Certified, well then you're still a member! Now, I have to go get my cancellation form, fill it out again, and then go to the post office to have my mail certified! Oh and I have to do this now because if I don't do it within their given time frame, they will charge me again! They shouldn't be able to do this. They're ripping me off, right in front of my face! It needs to be stopped now."
1431,218180,2010-03-31,,"Every time we go to the Gym, it is unbearable inside the women locker, by the sauna and women's bathroom. The Gym has a problem that it smells like sewer or septic tank smell. Every time we do mention when they will do something about it, all we get is ""we are working on it."" The reality is that you cannot breath, you have to take a gulp of air and hold it before you go in to change or use the lady's bathroom. The problem has to be a health issue and when you are going to a Gym to enjoy a work out and be healthier, it is not the ideal situation."
1432,218179,2010-03-29,,"I signed up for personal training sessions with the now personal training sales Manager Brian **.I was hesitant to do so because I have been working out for years and feel I know what I am doing. I also did not find any of the trainers knowledgeable enough (except for Brian) to give me a good work out. I was also unsure if I could afford it and have the time to commit to a personal training schedule. I was told by Brian that he would make a exception with me and he would train me. I was also promised free sessions at this time. He told me there is a 12 month commitment, but if I could not afford it or was not happy, he could cancel it at any time. He would just say ""I moved out of the area"". We negotiated 7 sessions for one month. He had me sign what I thought was to bill my credit card. It was a small screen like at most stores that you would pay using your ATM or credit card. On the screen was just an area to sign my name, but it was actually a contract. He did not disclose to me the details of the contract.I asked if my credit card would be billed automatically every month or do I have the option to negotiate the number of sessions per month. He said no, the card is not billed every month and yes, if I want to negotiate the number of sessions for next month I could. I was given some diet info & a booklet for keeping track of my training. Behind the diet info was a contract that I had no idea I signed. He told me to look at the diet info. Nothing was said about a contract. I had no reason to question him. I felt I could trust him. It turns out he lied on all of these issues. Within one month, he forgot 2 appointments we had, & doubled booked himself with 2 of us one time. Then he told me he was going to become sales manager & could not train me any more. I told him that we might as well forget the contract. He got agitated & wanted me to give this other trainer a try. I felt pressured and said yes. I asked how I could get rid of the 12 month agreement if I was not happy. He said I would have to show a return address out of town. Just mail a friend a letter to their address with my name on it & he will honor that. So I tried the other trainer & was okay with working out with him but still unsure if I wanted to continue this service. My husband lost his job & we are just relying on my income and his unemployment. Now I get a bill from American Express. $161 was charged to my account from La Fitness. I brought the statement into Brian. He said it was not for personal training, but then looked it up on his computer and told me it was for personal training. I asked if I could negotiate the number of visits for the next month due to less income. He said that would be okay & he also would freeze my contract for one month. He was in a hurry & could not talk. I thought okay, I will use the sessions I paid for & the free sessions he promised me.About 2 weeks later I had 2 sessions left that I paid for ,so I asked Brian how do I go about using my free sessions he promised me. He looked aggravated but looked on the computer at my contract ( which I still had no idea I signed). He said he did not write down any free sessions so he must not have promised me. He told me he gave me a great deal to begin with. I questioned him again. He started becoming very defensive & sarcastic, asking what would make me happy. I told him I did not appreciate his tone. He then stepped away from the computer, pointed his finger in my face and yelled, ""I don't appreciate you calling me a liar!"" He was yelling at me. I was scared & embarrassed. I said, ""I am done,"" and went into to changing room. I was shaking and was crying really upset & scared. I realized at that time I have been scammed and felt very betrayed. I went to go talk with him to resolve this issue. He would not talk to me, waved his hand & said, ""I am done with you."" I have 2 witnesses who saw him scream at me the first time. They were shocked at his reaction and agreed he was out of line. I called American Express. They said if I signed a contract that they could not waive the auto bill charge. I was going to cancel my card, that is when they put the payment on freeze. On 2/9 I called general manager, Billy. He said he would look into it. He called me back and stated Brian denies losing his temper and to call corporate. I spoke with a Tyler. He told me he could not void the contract. He told me that I could get out of the contract but had to pay 50 % of number of sessions that I agreed to for a year. I was unaware that I agreed to a certain amount of sessions. He told me that I sound upset & suggested I freeze my membership for 6 months until my emotions settle. I did not agree with this and just wanted to be done with the club & the contract. He said that it looks like I like the work outs because I was so consistent. He said he would look into this matter but probably could not discontinue the contract, because it was basically Brian's word against mine.On 2/12, I sent in a written request to stop all services, membership & personal training. La Fitness agreed to cancel my membership. I received a letter in the mail stating personal training membership will be cancelled once the initial term that I agreed upon is up. If I am still within my term & want to cancel & it is not for a reason stated in the contract, I will then be responsible for 50 % of the contract. I have not agreed to this. My card is still freezing this payment. I had to request this again because LA Fitness is saying that I need to honor the contract. My card states my credit will not be affected. And even if I cancelled American Express, the contract would still have to be honored if I lost. Please help. I feel stuck & scammed!I know 2 more people who are unhappy with the personal training service and are looking into cancelling. One girl states she was told by Brian that she can cancel at any time, just to show her letter of change of address or work. I do not know if she has done this yet. If she cannot cancel, she may be interested in a class action suit. "
1433,218177,2010-03-28,,"I cancelled my membership using the LA Fitness form and mailed it in. They charged me for two months past the agreed upon cancellation time frame and when I called the home office, the customer service manager told me I should have sent the cancellation form using certified mail, even though there were no requirements on the form to do so. They had no answer as to how one would send certified mail to a PO box, which is the only address to be found on the web site or form. It is deplorable business practice."
1434,218178,2010-03-24,,"I called for a price quote. I asked for a senior rate and the manager told me I have to bring in proof of age. Not a problem. All I want is a rate for the seniors. He told me it's a non published rate. I asked several times for the rate and he still refused to tell me. I tried to communicate more questions and he started lecturing me. Tried to call the home office and no number is listed. They lost my business. I'll go down the road to Bowie Sport Fit, better customer services and refreshing, polite staff. "
1435,218176,2010-03-22,,"Every time the sauna goes out, it takes three or more days to repair (it has now been 6 days this time). I don't feel this is right, as many members as this club has and the amount of money each member pays ""the sauna should be repaired within 24 hours."" It's like going to a restaurant and them not having whats on the menu. Members not receiving services, contractually agreed too."
1436,218175,2010-03-20,,"I am a member of LA fitness in Plainfield, NJ. I was registered with start-up fee of $75. I was supposed to get membership for multi club membership. Jason the sales rep mixed up and registered me for single club. I used to work in Plainfield, but I live in North Brunswick. I am now a full-time student and no longer working. There is a club in North Brunswick and I wanted to go and transfer the membership to that location. They told me I can’t transfer but all I can do is upgrade to multi-location for $99. The maximum start up fee is $150 for regular membership. I would end up paying $174 for utilizing the membership (more than I would if there was no specials at that time). Marge, the so-called manager, confirmed that Jason made a mistake, and said that she will call me next day to see if her manager can do something. Guess what, she never called. When I called her she said she’s busy and can’t speak with me. I called the next day. Someone picked up and told me that he is Marge’s manager and he can’t do anything, and I can complain all I want. I cancelled my membership. I want to file a law suit on LA Fitness and fight back the injustice done."
1437,218174,2010-03-19,,"After having a total hip replacement and returning to the gym (LA Fitness), I was anxious to get back to my prior fitness level. I was approached for signing up for personal training by Tim D. As a registered nurse and fitness instructor, I was really impressed with the routine Tim put me through. I expressed interest in working out with him only and was advised that he would be my personal trainer. I did sign up for 6 months' training, one time a week, under the impression that Tim would be the one to train me. Not only that, when I signed the contract I was not informed by him verbally that there would be a penalty if I chose to end the contract early. When I saw the small print in the contract I noted that there was a penalty for early cancellation of personal training up to 60% of what is owed for the remaining time left. I worked out with Tim a few times over about 4 weeks under the impression he would train me. Then on 3/5/10 I was informed by Gerald K. that Tim would not be my trainer and I was assigned to another trainer that I had not established a rapport. I felt confused, jerked around and felt that the way this was handled (money money money), was completely unprofessional and unbusiness-like. Additionally, don't buy into the sales technique they use to buy personal training for one year. I was told that if I signed up for one year, that after I would just need maintenance. Also my body fat was measured using a contraption that had no scientific validity for using this to calculate body fat. Each statement lacks any scientific validity to support said statements. I called Zenoni at Corporate on 3/12/10 and complained about the lack of professionalism. She was not impressed and I had the feeling she could care less. Finally to get me off the phone, she told me she would contact the local VP by the name of Charles A. To date I have not heard anything from either of these individuals.The moral of the story is watch out for LA Fitness, do not join and just find some local gym that is interested in your well-being, not just your wallet. I am left with no choice but to continue with the personal training as there was no compensation for my stress and frustration. "
1438,218173,2010-03-19,,"I am 75 years old and started the personal training program in Oviedo, Fl. I was told if ever needed to cancel I would just need a doctor's note. I had gone to my physician after having abdominal pain. It turned out that I have two inguinal hernias. I received a letter from the doctor to give to LA Fitness and they refused to cancel my $120.00 training sessions. They stated I would need another note. This note stated to discontinue my training sessions, all exercise and heavy lifting. LA Fitness denied this letter also and said I could in no way get out of my contract, they would have to put in on freeze for $15.00 per month because hernias get better and I would be able to come back. Give me a break, I am 75 years old and would not want to continue with the severe pain I have with my hernias. Who do they think they are? What do I do now?"
1439,218172,2010-03-19,,"I have been having this problem with an individual named Austin that works there at this location. He’s harassing my father. I tried talking to the person in charge of him and he had an awful attitude toward the situation and has tried contacting the vice president Dean. No luck with this and it is very sad to see how poor customer service they provide to their ""valued customers"". I would like to discuss this with someone who will do something to resolve this issue. "
1440,218171,2010-03-18,,"Before I signed in for both the monthly membership and the personal trainer sessions, the guy that signed me up, his name was Gabriel, told me that I could cancel at any time since I told him that was one of my requirements to get the memberships. So, I started going to the gym and I liked the facilities for regular exercise but the ""training sessions"" were awful, with even one of the trainers sharing too much information with me rather than focusing in the work out, as it is only exactly 30 minutes for $40! So, after a few sessions with different personal ""trainers"", I went back to the manager and told him that I wanted to keep my regular membership but I wanted to cancel the training sessions because those did not have any value and I was really dissatisfied with the service. Basically, to make the long story short, after countless efforts, this guy treated me like a rag even when he talked to me like I was so much inferior to him. Basically, he said I would have to pay the whole year in training session premiums before cancelling and of course I didn't. Extremely, bad customer satisfaction with the training services which do not provide the value they should, with the money you are paying. "
1441,218170,2010-03-16,,"I signed up for an annual, prepaid membership at LA Fitness about 4 years ago. At the time, there were some rates that were pretty close to each other at LA Fitness, and some that were much cheaper at other gyms. The members of my family have been longtime LA Fitness members, so I chose to pay more and sign up with LA Fitness. At the time I signed the agreement, I was promised (verbally, and in writing) 2 extra months for ""every year"" that I renewed before the expiration date. For this reason, I chose my plan over the other plans that I was considering. Last year, I needed to renew my membership for the first time. I went to LA Fitness Diamond Bar and dealt with a manager, Larry. He pretended to listened to my grievance and feigned sympathy, but ultimately refused to even address my issue. Basically, if you have ever talked to a customer service representative who would continually tell you, ""I understand how you feel, but..."" without really answering your argument, you'd know how frustrated I felt.Though Larry ""showed"" respect by being patient in the way he talked to me, his true lack of respect for customers shone through in the way that he refused to directly answer my questions--choosing instead to hide behind words like, ""company policy"" and ""legally you can't do anything."" (He said that LA Fitness was not obligated to honor promises made verbally, and in writing, by their sales representatives because such promises were not printed out by their computer, but were instead merely ""scribbled"" on my contract).I finally went to the LA Fitness in La Verne, where I was allowed me to get my 2 free months without any hassle, and I thought my problem was solved. ""I'll just go straight to La Verne next year"". Well, this is next year, and I found out that, not only was I not given one of my free months, but also that I would no longer be given my free month next year (even though corporate office had promised it to me if I renewed before my membership expired). I called Mark, and I felt like I was talking to a clone of Larry. However, Mark was somewhat ruder (if that's really possible), because he would cut me off as I was speaking.I'm extremely frustrated now, because I feel swindled. LA Fitness representatives promised me a ""pay more now, pay a lot less later"" plan, but they're now only going to fulfill the ""pay more now"" part of the plan. However, more than anything, I'm extremely irritated by how unreasonable their managers are. Mark kept telling me that it's not fair to make an exception for me by giving me an extra month--without ever bothering to stop and consider how unfair it is for me to be promised something, and then have this promise be revoked (three years later) without reason. I would, in all likelihood, not have signed this exact deal if I knew that they would consider honoring their promise to be a goodwill gesture, as opposed to something they should do because, really, a promise is a promise.I seem to have no choice but to cut my losses and just accept this hand that was dealt to me but I just hope that someone successfully sues LA Fitness in the near future. Someone needs to teach this company about honoring their promises and claims."
1442,218169,2010-03-07,,"When I initially joined LA Fitness, I was told that the fee I was paying would include me having a personal trainer. I told the representative, Bret, who was new at the time that I only wanted to join the club because I would be able work with a personal trainer. I made it very clear that I was only joining for this reason. He assured me that I would be able to work with the trainer and there would not be any additional fees. The day I signed up, I waited an hour for the trainer, Steve, to arrive. Only Steve was not a trainer, he was a fitness manager. After sitting down with Steve and discussing my fitness goals, he presented me with a ProResults Program Payment sheet. At this point I became upset. I told Steve that I was told that my membership included a personal trainer. Steve laughed and said if that was true then everyone would have a trainer. I was quite sure he knew that I was frustrated at this point. My husband also became frustrated because he was sitting there when Bret told us that my membership would include a personal trainer. I told Steve that I really needed a trainer and that I could not pay all of this extra money because I thought that it was included in the membership. I also told him that I would have never joined if I knew that the fee did not include a trainer. After sitting there getting nowhere, Steve said that I could come in the next day for a free training session. Only this was not a training session, we sat for an hour trying to figure out what deals they had that I could afford. I really felt that Steve was trying to help me. Steve told me that he could give me 3 free training sessions in order to compensate for the $149 trainer enrollment fee and then I could pay $90 for 3 sessions. The total I was to pay was $239. This was for a total of 6 sessions. I was so excited. I thought he was really hooking me up because he felt my pain. He also stated that I could pay $40 if I needed any additional sessions later. I told Steve that that sounded good, and I came back and gave him my credit card. I asked him just to be sure if this would be the only charge, no surprises, and to charge it to this particular credit card, because my husband made it very clear to Steve and I that I could not charge the 239 to his card. I asked him again if this would be the only thing I would have to pay for because I just needed someone to show me how to use the machines in the gym and give me a workout routine. He said this would be a onetime fee and I would not have to pay anything else. Needless to say Steve lied. I am being charged money every month and I am in the process of trying to get the situation resolved. It has led me to a dead end. I was so excited to join a gym, but I hate that I joined LA Fitness."
1443,218168,2010-03-05,,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for in my life! They don't care about their staff and have no integrity. All they care about is the next person that walks through the door so they can take their money. I'm embarrassed to have ever worked for them.
1444,218167,2010-03-04,,"I recently joined the LA Fitness in Robinson Township, PA and it was one of the worst decisions that I have made in my adult life. This facility is so grossly oversold that words cannot adequately describe the situation, but I will try. There are 30-minute time limits on the cardio equipment, you need to register 30 minutes prior to classes to get into an aerobics or spin class. Even then, the rooms are packed, there are lines at the water fountains, 10 people deep, and don't even think of walking away from a piece of equipment to use the bathroom (which is downstairs) or you will return only to find your stuff moved onto the floor and someone--or better yet, some people now using the equipment. While I do not use the nursery, I feel sorry for the kids that are in there and their parents could be considered unfit for leaving their children in such conditions. The ratio of kids to staff seems so out of whack that it strikes me as unsafe. It is painfully obvious that the management only cares about volume at all cost and not one bit about your future experience once you walk away from the sales desk where they promise you the world and then provide four walls, a roof, and some gym equipment to share with literally thousands of other members that all happened to get the ""Special Limited Time Only Promotional Pricing.""Furthermore, they will tell you anything to get you sign up--flat out lies! I would urge anyone considering joining this place in the strongest of terms possible. Before you join, visit it several times specifically the evenings and weekends. I switched from another local club because it was $20 a month cheaper and now I realize that I'm not saving $20 a month--I'm wasting $29.95. The membership is unusable. I'll be returning to my old gym and eating the monthly dues at LA Fitness because I'm locked in for two years."
1445,218166,2010-03-03,,"I had been going to L.A Fitness for 6 months. I then became a full time student in college. I asked the lady at the desk if I could cancel my membership, so I filled out some paperwork and she said it would be done. Well i haven't been working for about 4 months and I get a letter stating that I owe them 44$. I get phone calls day and night harassing me about it. I told them I haven't been to the gym in over 3 months. She said it did not matter and that I owe them. This place is a huge scam."
1446,218165,2010-03-02,,"My wife purchased me a membership and personal training sessions at LA Fitness in Denton, Texas on December 7th, 2010. At that time, she was charged $146.12 for initial membership fee and $222 for personal training set up and first month. She was then billed for these additional sums: $32.46 on January 5th, 2010 for another month of membership fees. On January 14th, 2010, I visited the LA Fitness in Denton for my first trainer session which was to include a fitness assessment. When I arrived for my appointment, the trainer was sleeping. I woke him up at his desk and he took me over to begin working out on weights. I asked him for a tour since I had never been to the facility. He took me on a tour. He did not know the locker policy for the facility. He then took me over to do some free weights. I told him that I should receive a fitness assessment first. He said that he could not do the assessment, and that the proper trainer to do so was not there.He then said that I needed a trainer booklet, but could not locate one to give me. He said, ""That's corporate fitness for you. Corporate fitness sucks."" I asked what he meant by that. He stated, ""LA Fitness fired me from the Lewisville store. The Denton facility was opened too early and we don't even have a scale to weigh you on for the assessment, or the booklet you are supposed to receive."" He then was given permission to give me the fitness assessment on my next visit, even though he stated that he was not officially allowed to administer assessments.When I arrived home, I contacted his supervisors and spoke with them about getting a refund as I did not feel comfortable patronizing LA Fitness in Denton after this experience. My wife spoke with 'Angela' and 'Issac,' both fitness trainer supervisors. Both indicated that they would not refund any money. On January 19th, 2010 we were billed for another month of trainer fees worth $172.00 and another charge for $32.46 on March 1st, 2010 when my wife received threatening phone calls requesting that we pay for another month of membership or we would be have 'credit problems.' My wife stated again that she wanted the membership cancelled and our money refunded. LA Fitness refuses to refund anything to us."
1447,218164,2010-02-27,,"My complaint is really wanting to know why I pay 50 bucks a month and I hear a lot about people I know paying 30 bucks a month for the same services I'm receiving. Should I cancel my membership and go somewhere else? Because I really feel like I'm being ripped off, when I could be paying 30 bucks. Also, I love LA Fitness, but I feel like I""m paying too much, and my god mom signed up after me maybe last month. And I have been with LA Fitness since last year, and she pays 30 bucks. Someone please tell me what should I do about my situation."
1448,218163,2010-02-23,,"I had my membership put on suspension, due to not being able to attend enough. Which means the month to month membership changes went from $30.00 to $10.00 until you can attend again. My card was being billed monthly. In Aug. 09 my card expired and L.A. Fitness sent a letter asking me to contact their accounting office with a new credit card information to continue membership. Well I didn't contact them because I didn't want to continue the month to month contract. I never signed up for two years contract or anything like that. It was month to month and I could cancel my membership at any time. Well, I would think if you quit paying, you would be cancelled. Well, I received a call from a collection company telling me I owed them for the past seven months one week after I received a phone call and an e-mail asking if I would like to renew my membership for the same terms of $30.00 a month and only $60.00 fee. I declined then I get this call from collections. What is my recourse? They threatened to send this to the credit agencies, for a month to month that I wasn't even using. "
1449,218162,2010-02-06,,"This place is disgusting. It is never clean with used sweaty paper towels all over the place. Frequently, it runs out of towels to wipe down the machine and even the sanitizer is often gone. This place is simply a health hazard. Can you imagine? My wife went to the bathroom and there were used sanitary pads and other stuff overflowing from the receptacles, a real hole. The health department should close them up before someone really gets sick or gets HIV infected! The management just doesn't care, not the membership director or the operations manager!"
1450,218161,2010-02-04,,"I have been trying to cancel the membership as I am no longer able to attend due to serious injury and surgery. It will be quite a while before I can even think about attending a gym. The process is ridiculous. I did mail the form and have not heard anything and am still getting billed. When I looked up the customer service number, I get the local LA Fitness."
1451,218160,2010-02-03,,"I joined LA fitness about a year ago. At first, it seemed to be a good place to work out. I am an avid swimmer and liked that they have a pool. The initiation fee was $100 and about $37 a month. After a couple months, my brother wanted to join and when we went to get it done, we were told by the salesperson that if he signed up under my account, he would get a discount and he would pay the same amount after his initiation fee of $100. After signing, we went to the locker room and there is a sign plain as day on the wall reading ""free initiation for this week."" I immediately went back to the same salesperson and he told me that because he signed up under my account he could not receive the free initiation. I got very upset and asked for the manager. I told her what had happened and after a workout's length worth of arguing, she said to call corporate and there was nothing she could do. Nothing she could do? I signed up with them less than five minutes before! I called corporate and they just referred me back to the gym. My brother then told me to just forget about it and he would pay the amount and it didn't really affect me anyway. I found out that it would definitely affect me soon. About four months later, my brother was going off to college so we went to the desk and asked to cancel his name from my account. They said that they couldn't do this in person and printed me a form to send to corporate. I asked them if the form had any specific information trying to find a reason why I had to mail a form to corporate. They said no and my next question was obviously, ""Why do I have to send in a form? Here is my ID do it now because I don't want to be charged for another month."" They then said to call corporate and they will hold my brother's payment until the form is received. I called and the customer service rep said she would do just that. Guess what, it didn't happen.Four months, three forms and numerous calls to corporate later and I have still not had my brother cancelled from my account or reimbursed for the four months of payments. I spoke to the manager at the gym and she told me that there is no record of my brother scanning in since he left in September and he has proof that he is a member of a gym near his college. My next step (other than just complaining) is to file a fraud report with my bank. They will reimburse me for the amount and investigate LA fitness. I have ample proof to assist with this. I recommend this course of action to anyone who uses credit or debit to pay for their membership (especially automatic payment). I do not understand how companies can get away with this sort of thing. It is obvious they only have you send out the form to squeeze that extra month out of you (or in my case, several). There is absolutely no reason we cannot cancel at the same place we signed up. The funny thing is I don't just blame LA Fitness, I blame the U.S. government. There are millions of complaints on thousands of businesses about this very type of issue. Companies squeezing little bits of money here and there from patrons which doesn't seem like much but adds up to millions. From 0 - $2000, almost no lawyer will take your case. So this window of money is perfect for any company to screw people out of. I am tired of complaining and absolutely nothing being done by anyone. All it is is complaining at this point. "
1452,218159,2010-02-02,,"I have mailed in a cancellation form two times, for my husband and I. I called them again because this is the third month I am being charged and they say they have not received the cancellation forms. This is also the third time I will be mailing this in. They have overcharged my account $40 because they ""have not received"" two cancellation requests."
1453,218158,2010-02-01,,"I actually enjoy using the gym until I have a problem, and unfortunately, I have had a problem several times. You go on their website to complain, and they just direct you to your local gym. Now, the people at the local gym don't really seem to care about what your problem is, and I have never had anyone actually try to help me. Since they don't really seem to be monitored, because obviously corporate seems to stay out of the local club's business dealings, no one tries to give good customer service at all. I have always been blown off and basically have gotten the impression that it is just my problem and there was nothing that I could do. It may take forever to get into each individual story, but the biggest complaint is that you cannot get a hold of anyone. Does the corporate office even have an email address? Does the corporate office even exist? Of course, when I get frustrated and decide that I do not want to deal with this club any longer, they make it almost impossible to quit. Someone really needs to start overseeing these clubs, because they have got to have the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. I will explain briefly my most recent situation. I had frozen my account for a short period of time at the gym. About 2 months later, I started getting emails from La Fitness saying that they wanted me back. I was confused because I hadn't quit, so I ignored the emails. I kept getting them, so I opened it. It said that if I re-sign up, I will get my membership and half the fee and no sign-up fees. So I thought great. I rejoined and figured that since they were sending me these emails, that it would somehow cancel my old account. They charged for 2 months, first and last month's. I then saw that online I was getting charged for the frozen account too. I tried to log onto my account, but it kept saying that it was invalid. I called up there and talked to a young girl who had no idea what to do. She said that I can cancel online. I told her that I could not even access my account. She said she would unfreeze it and that should help. As soon as she unfroze it, I got another email stating that I was charged a full month's service for unfreezing the account. This is 3 times I am being charged. I called the next day for a manager, and she told me that there was nothing that she can do. Until I properly cancel the accounts, I was just going to keep getting charged for both accounts. She did not even try to listen to the mix up of the situation. There was no one willing to work with me or apologies or anything. She just told me that until I send in the forms and canceled, there was nothing that they could do and they were going to continue to charge me. Also, I had signed my mother up too, so now I am being charged for 3 accounts. My mistake, so now I have to eat it, and there is nothing they are planning to do to get this resolved for me. It is absolute horrible customer service."
1454,218157,2010-01-27,,"This is a follow up on my original complaint. Orlando *** with the corporate office of LA Fitness called me back and took care of everything. He also said that he would work on the fact that the facility Operation Manager's claim that they have no supervisor available to speak with customers. He also said that he would work on making cancelling a person's membership much easier. He also agreed it would be advantageous to send an email to members who have their accounts frozen just before their membership payments will start up again. All in all, he was extremely helpful!"
1455,218156,2010-01-26,,"On November 15, 2007, I signed myself, my daughter and my nephew up for memberships with LA Fitness to include a training plan. When I wanted to cancel my nephew's membership, as everyone else stated, it was an act of God that had to be processed and I was charged at least 4-months of additional membership fees amounting to $120. Then on September 28, 2008, I called to cancel mine and my daughter's memberships and was convinced to ""pay"" to put my account ""on-hold"" until we were ready to come back. But, what happened was they only put a temporary hold on my account and it started to automatically debit my account again for membership fees. So, on January 28, 2009, I spoke to Ronald at LA Fitness and he then, over the phone, cancelled my membership but, he put my daughter's account ""on-hold"" again. So, without any notice other than the confirmation email sent to me on January 28, 2009, they started to debit my account again in August 2009. The real kicker to this is my bank was bought out and credit/debit card number changed completely and yet LA Fitness was able to charge my account for 6 additional months, another $180. My first complaint is that LA Fitness does not feel that they need to notify a person that they are going to begin debiting their account again before they do it and somehow they were able to obtain credit/debit card information that I never provided to them. My second complaint is that there is no one at a corporate level that can assist with resolution to these issues and the only person you can talk to is at the facility level and they don't seem to have supervisors. What is this, a corporate stone wall?"
1456,218155,2010-01-24,,I have gone through their stupid cancellation policy and these thieves kept taking money out of my account. I will get to the bottom of this one way or another and I will never again have anything to do with them again. All these gyms are scum.
1457,218154,2010-01-23,,"There are thirteen treadmills when they are all in use. They all short circuit when people are using them. This is a serious safety concern. They just stop. There’s no warning. If someone was to hurt themselves, it could be serious. I have complained about these issues for over a year to management there at the club and I even contacted corporate. Still, nothing has been done."
1458,218153,2010-01-22,,"This past fall, I cancelled my membership with LA Fitness. Although, they did honor the cancellation on my membership, they continued to charge me for child care. When I realized what they had done, I called the club and spoke to a very young woman who claimed she is a manager. I explained what had happened and asked what I can do to recoup the unauthorized charges. She said there is nothing I can do to get my money back because the child care was a separate account and it was my responsibility to cancel that account as well. I said that doesn't make any sense. Why would I need child care when I am no longer a member? I asked to speak to her manager, as it is unlikely that a true ""manager"" would be answering the phones at the front desk. I am still waiting to hear from ""Tim"" but if he strikes the same tone, they will see me in small claims."
1459,218152,2010-01-21,,"I was a member of your establishment and due to a recent move and separation, I was not able to fit it into my schedule. So I had to postpone my gym membership and now I am back on schedule. I was invited by my co-workers and friends to try out the Spin class on a guest pass. We all had never participated in the class and wanted to check it out. We were all looking forward to friends getting together to enjoying an evening of fitness and fun. Well, that never happened and my friends were very upset for me as well as myself. I was denied access for some lame excuse that because I was a past member, I could not attend the class. If I wanted to attend, I must come up with $15.00 right there and then. I had only come in with my I.D. because I am a ""guest."" There really is no back up or truth behind his reason. You have records of guests as well as visitors so you can see if someone is abusing a pass.Look, we all know how a business is run and that sure is not the way. If you want to continue bringing in new and recent members, let me advise you that is sure not the way to do it. Not only myself, but my friends and boyfriend whom I couldn't work out with were totally disgusted with the manager, Phil **'s actions and excuse. LA Fitness has put a bad taste in business etiquette for me and my friends and anyone else who has heard the story. Way to go LA Fitness!"
1460,218151,2010-01-21,,"On 01/17/2010, I was at Ashley's furniture store in Altemonte Springs, Florida. When I left the store, I noticed every car in the parking lot has a free 7 day pass from LA Fitness placed in the window on the driver's side. It surprised me because I only see this kind of advertising placed on cars' windshields. Anyhow, I tried to take the card out but it was tucked in deeply. I tried to roll the window down but the card went inside the door along with the glass. I took another card from the car parked next to me and it had this address: LA Fitness, 1074 Montgomery Rd., Altemonte Springs, FL 32714,Tel: 407-304-8020. On the back it was stamped by Tonya who is apparently one of the salespersons. I contacted Tonya, Mike, the manager, Jenna, another manager,and Tammy and I left several messages and would not return my phone calls. They were extremely rude and uncooperative and would not give me any information. Now I need to bring my car to the Dealership to get out the card that was unlawfully put in my car to avoid future problems. I have already sent a letter to the corporate office in Irvine, California. I should not be responsible to pay for someone else's idiotic actions and lose one day of work to take care of it. "
1461,218150,2010-01-21,,"I was coming in to work at my place of employment and 3 guys from LA Fitness had a table and signup sheets. One of them asked me if I wanted to join and I said no and went in to work. Supposedly one guy said that ""I had a fat ** and cottage cheese leg and he would even put his face in between by legs and made graphic remarks about my ** and backside"". He told many customers who were outside of my work and they told him not to say those things. The guy did not care."
1462,218149,2010-01-21,,"My husband and I went into LA Fitness to cancel our membership. The Operations Director, RJ, convinced us to freeze our account through the winter. After agreeing to keep our membership, we were still charged our monthly fees after being told that we would not be charged. It overdrew my account and I am still trying to get my money back and pay all of the fees that my account was charged for being overdrawn. I went in to confront them and cancel. I was told that I had to mail a form to the corporate office and that my membership would be cancelled when it was received by the corporate office. Do not join LA Fitness. It is impossible to cancel your membership. I am still waiting for my membership to be cancelled."
1463,218148,2010-01-18,,"My regular gym had closed, (they gave me a deal that LA Fitness, the much closer gym, wouldn't). I went to look at LA Fitness a week ago to see if I liked it. So I walked up to and boarded a bus that took me 2 miles to the gym, (I am disabled). I was allowed access and I appreciated that. I didn't have time to really work out so I walked around a bit, stepped on a treadmill to see if it was old and/or slipped, walked through the weights section, went in to see the locker room etc. In the locker room, I discovered a bunch of coupons, signed by Chris for a 7 day free trial. It was perfect! I didn't have to hurry through and make a decision right away and could work out anytime during a 1 week period. I took the coupon and exited. I was there less than 1/2 hr. I could still catch a bus and get to where I was going in plenty of time. Okay, a few days after I walked through the gym, I received a call from Jay asking me if I'm going to join. I told him Ryan let me take a look and then told him about the coupon and he told me fine. All I need to do is bring my license and I'll get a 7 day pass. I even set up an appointment time for me to start. It was today, (1/18). Also today, the person who said I could have that free access that day, Ryan, called me and asked me if I was joining the gym. I told him, I got a 7 day pass and was coming in to use it, today. He said, ""Great. Come on in. Get your 7 day pass and then we'll talk"". I took the bus, went in, and talked to the guy who's name was on the coupon, Chris. He proceeded to tell me that I couldn't use the 7 day pass because I was already given a 1 day pass. What?!I told him, ""I was told to come here and use my 7 day pass by the guy who let me have that 1/2 hr access (Ryan). Not only him but another guy told me the same thing (Jay). I let them both aware that I was there that 1 day. Ryan, in fact was the guy that let me do it and he never said a word about this. In fact, he told me to come on down to the gym"".Chris, then went to get Ryan and Ryan told me the same thing. He said, that 1 day was it! I have to join right now, or go home. The attitude was very different now. I told him, ""You told me to come and do the 7 day trial yourself. Why didn't you tell me I had to join, or else?. Instead you told me to come."" He said that he didn't realize I had that 1 day access.(What?). Either he was stupid or lying (I'm sure it was the latter), because it was made clear to me on the phone that he knew. He also knew I was just there for a walk around and not a workout and that I was only there for less than a half hr. He goes, ""Well, what else do you need to know? You saw what we had. So now, you know. Join or go home"". (in so many words. In fact his last words were, ""Go find another gym that will let you work out for free"").There are so many things wrong on so many levels with that kind of treatment..I don't even know where to start. First of all, why wasn't I told there was such a thing (apparently, standard and normal procedure), as a 7 day trial period when I arrived that 1st day? Do you know the only way one could get that coupon was by going into the locker room on a visit? How the heck is a person off the street supposed to know? Only, when into the gym lockers would one know.Secondly, I'm okay if I knew that the1 time was it. I would have spent more time looking around, asking questions, etc. Ryan goes, ""You've seen everything so what do you need 7 days for?"" Why do they even have those passes then? My questions and things I would have sought out were things like ""I hear you can't get a treadmill at night because it is too crowded, how is the shower pressure, is the tiny sauna always full, as it was the day I was there, when is the best time to come, etc."" I would have checked out those (especially going at night since that would be when I could go), and many other things that I'd want to know during the 7 day trial, before plunking down a $400 commitment.This is unprofessional and I was lied to. What a great advertisement Ryan is for the class of LA Fitness. I was disgusted. Anyway, that's my story. Now, there is so much. But do you know what Ryan, said to me, about all the ** I had to go through? He said, ""Well, you're wasting our time."" The rest of the event was mostly emotional. No one likes to be insulted, especially by the guy who invited you to the party, so to speak, then yanks away the invitation with an insult to boot."
1464,218147,2010-01-16,,"Every time I go in to work out, the facility is very dirty! The bathroom is so dirty that it is almost unbearable and the children's bathroom, in the daycare, is even worse! If I am paying for a service, I expect for it to be clean and orderly, especially if it is somewhere where my child is!"
1465,218146,2010-01-16,,Manager very rude! She told me if I wanted a work out to go some place else and to hurry up. She wanted to close as she was stuffing her face with candy. The facility was supposed to be open for another 20 minute. I won't go back.
1466,218145,2010-01-14,,"FYI, I just visited LA Fitness in Tukwila, WA. Nice facility, but I did notice that not one TV monitor had Fox News. I asked the front desk why and she said there was a block on the channel and it was corporate policy. I said that Fox News is the number one news network by a 2 to 1 margin and they should at least be balance and provide Fox and CNN. Buyer beware!"
1467,218144,2010-01-13,,"I went in to my local L.A. Fitness (Glendale AZ) on or about 20 Nov 2008 to cancel my gym membership. I was told I had to send a cancellation form request off to another L.A. Fitness in California and they would process the cancellation. I was handed the form and I filled it out and sent it off. A week later, I was deployed to Kirkuk, Iraq for six months. My membership didn't get cancelled and I had no way of knowing it. It had been an automatic deduction from my checking account. It wasn't until I moved in August of 2009 and switched banks that I was later notified that not only was I being charged for a membership I wasn't using, I was one month behind and I received a bill for one month's membership! Outrageous! I was out of the country for six months and unaware that I was being charged for another six months. I immediately called on 13 Nov 2009 when I found out my membership was never cancelled. I have been in the USAF for almost 17 years, deployed five times out of country (twice to Iraq) and I've never gotten the runaround or had this much trouble cancelling a service as I've had with cancelling my L.A. Fitness membership. I was told by a L.A. Fitness representative, Michelle, on 13 Nov 2009 at 08:30 a.m. Arizona time that I would be refunded $299.90 for 10 months and that the month or two I was now behind would be charged off. She said I would get a refund check for $299.90 in 5-6 weeks.I called Jan 13, 2010 to check up on the status of the refund because I never got it. I got a customer service rep named Cindy. She informed me that $74.97 was refunded back to the checking account that it came out of. I told her that 1.) This account was closed in August of 2009 and 2.) I was told I would get refunded $299.90. Cindy explained that they can only refund three months (not what I was originally told) and to call my bank and see what happened to the money. I called my bank and they said that the account is closed and there are no transactions that have occurred since the account was closed. (Exactly what I figured. How can they credit an account that no longer exists?) When I called Cindy back, she said the money was refunded and there is nothing L.A Fitness can do. I need to take it up with the bank! So here I am, out for a one year membership I didn't use and not even a three-month (or 10 month!) refund as promised! Help!"
1468,218143,2010-01-13,,"I cancelled my daughter’s membership in September because she started college and would not be using it. I went on the website, downloaded the form, completed it and mailed it! I was under the impression that it was cancelled and I just found out in January that LA Fitness never cancelled it and they refuse to refund my money. They said unless I sent it certified, I cannot receive a refund. The manager, Jack, also refused to provide me with his supervisor’s name or the contact information of anyone above him. I asked him how did he know that I intended to cancel in September, and he said that September 13th was the day that I went to the website to download the form. I told him that if he knew that, then I cannot help it if someone at the corporate office is not doing their job and canceling memberships in a timely manner. Would someone please help us? LA Fitness's business practices are unfair and they are taking advantage of consumers! I am due a refund of $162.38. If someone does not step in and stop them; they surely will continue to rip people off!"
1469,218142,2010-01-13,,"I got my younger cousin a gym membership for the summer when he is off of school. I was told by the LA Fitness guy that they had a specific summer deal. After summer, I just had to pay $25.00 and it will start again next summer. LA Fitness pulled the monthly charge from my account 3 months later. I called in to the corporate office assuming they made a mistake. I was told no such plan existed and to call my local LA Fitness. I called and talked to the operations manager. She told me she wasn’t there and therefore their policy stood. I told her that is unacceptable. She told me to call corporate. I’m sick of the obvious cat and mouse game. I told her I just wanted to cancel his membership. She told me I could come in and get a form or type a letter. I decided to type a letter because I also wanted to let them know about this situation. I send 2 letters to them with no response. I steadily call in. Finally, I got someone ""cool"" enough at LA Fitness to let me in on the corporate scheme. He told me they don’t look at any envelopes sent or read anything. All they do is scan their form. Their cancellation form is a print out that you're supposed to fold and has a bar code on it. I understand that is just hearsay, but I find their cancellation policy absurd and almost to the point of fraudulent. I can walk in and start a membership in 30 minutes but to cancel it takes weeks and they continue to bill you."
1470,218141,2010-01-07,,"For the past two weeks, we have been unable to have our aqua aerobics class because the pump in the pool has been broken and the water has been too cold. This has been happening over the years but this is the longest that it has not been repaired. There is also mold and mildew on the walls in the pool area. This is unacceptable. We are charged each month and cannot use the facility. Many of LA Fitness members have gone over to lifetime and members in my class are considering it as well as me. We need to be able to have our water aerobics class when they are scheduled."
1471,218140,2010-01-06,,"I contacted the corporate office when the Denton, TX club told me I couldn't see the contract Terms and Conditions, prior to giving them my information (including credit card) and them entering the sale in their system. The local club is fairly new, and I don't fault them for following the company policy, but I am one of the few who actually read contracts before signing. The local club assured me that I could back out at any time, but after reading so many complaints online, I was skeptical. I contacted the corporate office first on 1/5/2010 and was told that the club should be able to print out a blank contract, but he would email me one anyway. The email never came, so I called back on 1/6/2010. After two hung ups on their end, a lady told me that they were not allowed to send out Terms and Conditions in advance, because I ""might change them"" and that it wasn't a ""contract, it is a monthly agreement.""I think she needs to go take a basic business law class. She said that I could go to the club and read the Terms and Conditions, but they couldn't leave the club. Are you kidding me? At this point, I want an attorney to read over them, as I don't trust a business that operates this way. As I told her, I'm glad I found out how they operate before I signed up. Beware, this is not the type of business I want to work with. "
1472,218139,2010-01-06,,"I visit my family 3 times a year in Glendora, CA and I used to sign up for one time fee of $50 for one month.

He said I would pay a $140 one time fee and $34.99 per month. He said that when I'm out of town, I would not pay the monthly fees by putting a hold on the account until I come back, then they will reactivate the account. He said that there would be no fees for putting the account on hold and reactivating it. He said that there is also no need to have contracts because LA Fitness is very ecological. Well, it is full of **, when I left California, I called Travis to put my account on hold and reminding him that there should be no fees. Well, I came back to France and I see that my account is being debited every month for 434.99. I called them five times already, and now they tell me that Travis has been promoted as a manager in LaVerne office and that Peter is the new manager. I explained it to Peter and he told me he would take care of everything. However, I am still being debited every month and I still have not been refunded for those amounts. They keep promising to refund me the monthly fees unused, but up to know, nothing is done and they keep debiting my account for $34.99.

I also signed up for a 9-month personal training for $312 per month, which will end on November 23rd, 2009 and that would be the last payment. In September 2009, I received a letter from LA Fitness thanking me for signing up for 14 months starting mid-October 2009 for $168 per Month. I immediately called LA Fitness and told them that I did not sign up for this! I also told them that my plan was ending on November 23rd 2009. And I told them I also wanted my membership for the 29th to end in November. I asked if I should put something in writing, but they said, I didn't have to. I got them to look me up online and confirm. And they told me I did not need to do anything else. In December they took out the $29 from my credit card, but they also charged $168 which they were not authorized to do. I talked to my local LA Fitness and the manager, Andrew, told me I was right and that he would send an email to Corporate Office. That was December 16th 2009. They over drafted my bank account and in doing this, that cost me $35!On December 24th, 2009 they took out $312 from my account. I came back from my holiday and went straight to my local LA Fitness to ask what would be done! The Manager, Andrew, sent a new email and told me to close my credit card, so that it wouldn't happen again! And then he told me to try and call the Corporate Office, but he didn't give me any number. I left and called 411, and got a number for another branch. I called them and spoke to a very nice girl, who told me her manager would like to try and solve this before I call Corporate Office. The manager was busy and she would just call me back. She never did.It has cost me $168 + $29 + $312+ $35 by now. But the story is not over! I'll let you know how it goes! As I know, here in the US, when companies advertise on TV, they're allowed to say bad things about their competition. So, we should take our stories to one of LA Fitness competitors and let them use our stories in their advertising! Usually, I'm not about trashing others, but this is not right!"

I was quoted $34.99 for both memberships for a total of $69.98. They billed me $84.98. On 12/1/09, I paid them for two-month memberships, a first and last month, in case I cancelled. At the time of payment, I found they did charge me $84.98, but the person I signed up with stated it was start-up fees for the difference. I called them on 12/30/09 and told them to cancel my membership, as I had been trying for the last few weeks. At that time, they told me I had to print off a form and mail it. The website told me when I printed the form that I would have to pay for an extra month. So they billed me on 12/30, took the money out of my account, which I told them I did not want. I paid an extra month of membership to allow for the notice of cancellation. I should not have to pay an extra month of membership. I have not used the membership at all, as I have wanted them to cancel from the beginning. (I never used their facilities.) All correspondence sent to me through my email came from this address, but they never responded. I realize I should not be refunded for the first and last payments, but I should not be billed an extra month. "
1475,218136,2010-01-01,,"I suggest you call your bank and tell them you lost your credit card and request a new one. The club will not be able to withdraw funds anymore and they will not report anything to credit bureau. They will simply cancel your account. They do not have the infrastructure to do any more than that. You won’t be called or hassled. You would just be told at the desk that your account was canceled were you to try to get into a club afterward. Sounds south of ethical, but sometimes you need fire for fire. It’s easier to get a new card than to keep calling and hassling them. It’s what I did and it worked. The trouble is you will have to call anyone else who is drawing off that card and change your card number with them. But this is the quickest way. I’ve been through your plight. That's one reason I rarely use my debit card for automatic withdrawals for any bill paying except for utilities and such."
1476,218135,2009-12-30,,"I have a real bad experience with this company. First of all, their service sucks. As a member for six months, I used the gym for like two months only. After that, I didn't use it for the rest of the time and they never complained of me giving them my money for free. But when I missed two payments, they were calling me like five times a day, and it got worse. This gym is new and they never got good customer service. Their personnel are not friendly at all. I have two kids which I put them in. The kids club too, they only have two persons working on the kids club and they have like 20 kids on it. They don't take care of your kid’s right. My son complained to me and said that one of the daycare attendants was screaming on my daughter. She is 2 and my son is 7. My daughter went out of the club two times and they didn't even notice. But they didn't complain about my daughter being bad and after missing a payment, they called me several times and finally I spoke to one person and told her that I have to freeze my account since someone was using my credit card. And it would take 2 to 3 weeks to solve the problem. I told her I do not have any type of credit card or checks and I only have cash. She told me they could not take cash. So I told her that as soon I got my new card and new checking, I will go to the club and give them my new info. She said yes and told me that she would put a note to let the others in accounting know what happened to me and they would not call me anymore. But they did after an hour. I spoke to this person and they were calling me again. It just looks to me like they don’t have anything else to do. I work from 10 to 8pm, 6 days a week and I never answer my phone. We are not allowed to answer personal phone calls, and I could not call them back. But that was nothing since they could not get in contact with me on the phone. They started asking every single person whose last names are the same as mine, if they knew me to let me know that they have an issue with my account. They will give my name. They asked two persons that I know and they’re pretty close to me. They have the same last names but they are not related to me. They asked my sister-in-law so she can call me and let me know. I got mad because it was not the first time. I spoke to the manager on duty who professionally studies in management and not working at all. He called me a liar. He made me madder than I already was. This guy is not professional at all. He was screaming at me. Instead of trying to get things better, he got them worse. He was disrespectful, and instead of dealing with the problem himself, he put the girl who was responsible for all this mistake to deal with me because he could not do it. She doesn’t know what to say. She said that she missed to say somebody else’s name and she said mine and she also said the others person’s name. This person is irresponsible. What it is a client privacy? They don’t do that. They try to get their money no matter how. They are worst than the banks creditors. And even maybe you owe more money to them, they are not looking for you like this persons was. I would say after this experience with LA Fitness, I would give them a zero star and they don’t even have enough machines to workout. You have to wait in line to use them. The service and the gym itself suck. I would not recommend this gym to anybody who likes good customer services, friendly and confident."
1477,218134,2009-12-30,,"After a contract modification reducing the number of sessions we were purchasing with a physical trainer, LA Fitness overcharged our credit card $150 per month for 8 months in spite of many phone calls, meetings, letters with documentation, and our blocking the excess charges through our credit card company. Finally their accounting department reimbursed us for the overcharges but credited us $300 more than we were owed. LA Fitness immediately blocked our access to our physical trainer, despite the fact that we had over 30 sessions already paid for and that it was their error. Even after two 3-way conversations with LA Fitness with our credit card company assuring them the $300 had been re-charged to our account, we are still blocked two months later. LA Fitness does not respond to letter, does not return most phone calls, and stonewalls at all levels. They are woefully inefficient, uncaring, uncooperative, and unprofessional. They are ethically bankrupt and most likely dishonest and corrupt. We have lost the opportunity for many physical trainer sessions and have a large backlog of sessions already paid for. To drop LA Fitness we would lose several hundred dollars of sessions. Because my wife and I need motivation to exercise, our loss of our trainer caused our decline of physical activity and interest in exercise (I have gained about 10 pounds). Hopefully, we can regain our enthusiasm, but LA Fitness's intractability has caused us much duress."

This was not the location I was going to be working out in, and they assured me that the training sessions I was signing up for would be applicable to any of the gyms. When I tried to go to the gym that was my chosen location, I was refused entry and told I was not a member and physically removed from the premises. I was told my papers were in order and that the other gym only had to put it in the computer correctly. I cancelled my training sessions. I went to the other gym and they apologized and said they would take care of it. This happened 18 times. I was never allowed to work out at any time. The last time I tried was the first week of September, and I was taken crying from the club of my choice. I went back to the original club, and the other men who said they were the managers and that they were going to take care of it were mouthing “I'm sorry” behind some new man who said he's the manager and I will not ever be allowed in and it's up to him. My contract doesn't say I am a member and it doesn't say I'm not a member so get out. I took cancellation papers there and sent them in at the post office 5 minutes later. I had paid first, last and 8 months to never be allowed in any gym, and they are sending me threatening letters for more money."

For example, women's sauna room has not been working in mid-November and it is still out of order (December 29, 2009). To my knowledge, the cause of malfunction of the sauna room is only the timer which should be easily fixed. Many members including my self go to the fitness for having a warm sauna in the cold winter and yet we pay the full membership but could not use the facility!"
1480,218131,2009-12-29,,LA Fitness lies about canceling memberships. Never let them have access to your accounts. They will continue to take money at higher rates after they know you are leaving. They are liars and thieves. I intend to file charges of theft against them in LA. I would never believe anything they say.
1481,218130,2009-12-28,,"3 months after the expiration of my personal training sessions, LA Fitness started charging $100 per month on my AmEx card though I have not set foot there ever since. I called the Yorba Linda club and talked to the manager, who referred me to the training manager by the name of Blake. He said that it looked like the previous training manger Dean initiated the new charges just before he left. Blake promised to look into it and call back. He never did. I called back, and instead of addressing my issue, the manager tried to sell me on a new training and membership. She would not address my complaint. She also said that any cancellation needs to be in certified mail. I explained to her that this was not cancellation but new charges that are not related to the previous contract. She referred me to the corporate office without giving me the number.I googled the number in Irvine and got hold of Chris, who said that he will credit my credit back for the last two months. He did not explain why the charges took place in the first place. I asked him to confirm this by email, and he said he would do that. So far, I still don't have confirmation. We'll see. By the way, they are still charging $34.99 per month, though when I log in, the LA Fitness website tells me under my account tab that the current status is cancelled."
1482,218129,2009-12-25,,"I never signed up for the personal training at LA Fitness at 7422 Louetta Road, Spring, TX 77379. I paid for it every month. 8 out of 10 appointments that I made, the personal trainer was a no-show, even when I called earlier to make sure. Then when I got tired of it, I canceled my membership at LA Fitness. Yet, I find out that I was being charged several months, even after I quit and moved to Austin where there is no LA Fitness. Finally, I had to call and cancel. They have the worst service, and they deserve to be shut down."
1483,218128,2009-12-24,,"I signed up for a membership to LA Fitness in Spring 2009. I did not use the membership like I had planned. In fact, I wasn't going at all, so I decided to cancel my membership. LA Fitness has a policy that a paper has to be printed off, filled out, and mailed to California to cancel the membership. I did that even though to sign up, I just went to a facility. I did not understand why I couldn't do the same to cancel. So November 2009 should have been my last automatic withdrawal for LA Fitness. LA Fitness went ahead and deducted the $34.99 dues from my account in December. They were not authorized to do this. Then this caused three transactions to bounce in my checking account. When I called LA Fitness, upon which they had already refunded the $34.99 to my checking, I was told that I was lucky to have gotten the refund that they gave me. I was told that they would not refund me the fees that I was charged at my bank because of their mistake."
1484,218127,2009-12-23,,"I received two ""guest pass"" for the gym. One was for 1 day, and the other was for 7 days. I asked the manager which one was better to use and said, ""My sister is going to work out with me."" He asked if I had a membership, and I replied yes and that was how I got the coupons from the corporate website. He asked my sister if she lived around here. ""No, I am visiting from Mississippi."" ""Oh well, then we can't honor the guest pass. Only local residents qualify."" What crap is that! I told him the pass doesn't say anything about where you live. ""Sorry, it's the policy. It is on our wall."" He said it was to keep the riffraff out. He said we could work out if we paid $15.00. I decline and said there was no way I would have my sister pay to work out when we have a free coupon."
1485,218126,2009-12-22,,"It's obscenely difficult to cancel membership. If they are going to make it that difficult to cancel, then they should make it that difficult to join. Let them see how that affects their business."
1486,218125,2009-12-22,,"This was the LA Fitness located at the Kenwood Mall in Cincinnati Ohio. I was interested in joining LA Fitness. As a result, I decided to tour the facilities and meet with someone who could supply me with information. It took almost a week to iron out the details of the plan. As the company would supply nothing in writing to me, I was somewhat concerned. They wouldn't print out the plan that they could pull up on their computer for me with all of the details. They told me not to worry because all of the details were in the contract. This was not the case. I tried to sign up for the program online with a URL they provided to me. I decided not to complete my online application this way because as I went through the process, nothing stipulated my rights or the items I was promised. As a result, I called and asked them to fax me a copy of their contract. They faxed me one page, which did not include the majority of the details we discussed. I wrote an addendum to the contract with my specifics based on the conversation I had with the individual who was helping me. LA Fitness would not sign this page even though it outlined our discussions clearly and specifically. Then they faxed me another contract to sign; this one was three pages rather than one page. I was able to add in the details of our conversation in my handwriting to the first page. Then I crossed out the indemnity clause on a second page due to the fact that LA Fitness disclaims all liability regarding you or your children on the premises (whether on the equipment or in kid's care). They specifically disclaim all liability ""Whether caused by the active or passive negligence of LA Fitness or otherwise."" I crossed out this entire section for waiver of liability and indemnity because I don't believe if they are negligent, they should require a potential customer or customer to sign away any right to recourse. The general manager of the LA Fitness called me and said that I must sign that section for the contract to be valid. I explained to him that I was uncomfortable signing that LA Fitness has no liability even if LA Fitness is negligent. I asked if he or his corporate legal department could modify the agreement to something more reasonable and then I would sign the section. I was told that was not possible and I would need to sign the section as presented. As I was unwilling to do this, the manager said he was going to shred my contract. I am extremely frustrated at the effort on their part to not provide your rights as provided in conversation in their contract unless you go through hoops to put it in yourself. Then you can't even use their service unless you are willing to sign something completely unreasonable. Are they even allowed to disclaim liability from negligence by law even if in their contract? This is ridiculous."
1487,218124,2009-12-22,,"I joined LA Fitness in June 2008. They were new in town and seemed to offer everything I had wished for. After a few months, I realized that the class schedule wasn't the most convenient for me and many of the classes they said they offered weren't actually offered at my location. It was ok. I met a friend there a few days a week and we made the best of it until November 2009. I became engaged and thought it would be great to finally get focused and get in shape. I encouraged my fiance to join with me after receiving an email encouraging me to add family members to my account for a total of $105. We spoke to the Livonia, MI manager whose name is **. Apparently his nickname is **, but his name is **. He told me that the offer I had received via email was expired and no longer valid. I asked him to allow me to pull up my email and show him. He said he couldn’t do that. He went on to say that the offer I was referring to would only allow my fiance and I to work out together. He also wanted to charge us well over $200 to sign up. We repeatedly told him that didn’t make sense and he started his sales pitch about what a great deal I had on my account, that I had access to all signature clubs (although there were none in Michigan at the time) and bragged about the upcoming club in Royal Oak and how it was going to be a signature club. He called one of his co-workers over to look at the screen and was gushing about what a great deal I had, how he had never seen anything like that before, etc. ** or ** seemed shady and we weren’t willing to spend the money to sign up.We decided we would visit the Troy location, which I had been familiar with. I also decided to take advantage of my free personal trainer session and made an appointment. The Friday after Thanksgiving (11/27), we went to the gym and checked in. We told the lady at the desk that my fiance was interested in joining and I was there for my appointment. She was busy and said she would tell the trainer I was there and told us to go ahead and work out and check in with her before we left to register. I was waiting for the trainer and decided to go back to the front desk to make sure he knew I was there. She told me he was with someone, but was finishing up. I told her I would be on the treadmill and she said ** would come get me as soon as he was ready. ** never came.As we were leaving, we spoke to ** about a membership for my fiance. I told him I was disappointed about my session, but things happen, right? He started reviewing enrollment options, which were much more reasonable that **. We started telling him about what we were told and he involved the manager **. She was flabbergasted and could not believe **. She went on with her own monologue about how some of these people think LA Fitness is Bally’s. She provided us with an email address for the district manager **. My fiance signed up about the same time the trainer that I had the appointment with walked in. He said the lady at the front desk never told him I was there and offered to set up another appointment. So, I set up an appointment for the following weekend with him. That week my fiance sent an email to the district manager ** expressing his dissatisfaction. To date, he has not received any type of response at all. I went in for my session the next weekend (Saturday, 12/5) and was provided with pricing options. After thinking about it on Sunday and discussing the options with my fiance, I decided I couldn’t really afford it. I called on Monday morning and spoke with ** again. He asked if I would be willing to continue with the training if he reduced the price from $320/month to $240/month. I said that I would. He said he would call his manager and confirmed my appointment that night at 5:00. Might I add that my session on Saturday left me extremely sore for days to the point in which I could not even lift my arms high enough to put on makeup or put on a shirt.After work on Monday, 12/7, I went to LA Fitness to get the paperwork in order and go to my first official session. I stopped and talked with ** who was having difficulty with the system. He told me to go ahead with my session and check in with him afterward. I followed the direction and met back with **. I had been charged $419.99, which was the sign up fee for the original deal and the first month payment. The new deal was only for $339, so ** said I would receive an $80 credit to my account. He was having problems with the system and had to hand-write the contract, which stated I would receive an $80 credit. Some other manager ** was there and said he would handle everything. Happy days?Nope, on Wednesday, 12/9, I had two charges in my bank account: $419.99 and $379.00. I called ** right away and he said he would look into it and make sure my account was handled. In the meantime, I transferred money from my savings account into my checking account to cover the pending checks I had written. He never called back Wednesday or Thursday. I called him again on Friday (12/11). He said the credit had been processed and I should receive my credit any day. I asked about the $40 discrepancy it appears the friendly manager ** decided to charge me for the personal training session that took place before I had signed the contract, even though it was their system problem that caused it to happen. At no point did I ever agree to pay the $40. ** apologized and said he would give me a free session. Fine.On Saturday, 12/12, there was no credit in my account. I called first thing in the morning and the lady who answered the phone told me ** was with a customer and he would call me back. He didn’t. So, I called back on Saturday evening and spoke with the weekend manager **. He told me the credit would be in my account by Wednesday. I told him I wanted to cancel my gym membership and my personal trainer membership. He told me I had to wait until I received my credit and then I could cancel. ** called me on Monday and I couldn’t bring myself to talk to him at this point.On Monday night, 12/14, Shemean from corporate left me a message to confirm my training and left her number if I had any questions. I called her right back and left a message saying I had questions and would like a call back. I have not yet received a call back. On Tuesday, 12/15, I called **. He said the credits sometimes took a week, so it should be in my account by Friday, 12/18. By Friday, 12/18, there’s no credit to my account. I decided to stop in at lunch and make a personal visit. ** assured me that he was doing everything on his end to process the credit and that it sometimes took longer because everything had to be approved by corporate in LA. I told him that I was extremely dissatisfied with LA Fitness and wanted to cancel my membership. He told me if I cancelled, I would be charged half of the contract total because the three days had passed. I told him I had been expressing my desire to cancel since 12/9, but kept being brushed off had to wait for my credit, etc. He pretty much said that was the way it was. At this point, another manager ** was at the gym. He told me he would approve my credit that afternoon and corporate would receive it Monday. Evidently, corporate processes refunds on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I assume ** is the same manager my fiance emailed a month prior and still had not received a response. At this point, I realize I am totally screwed. I tried to make the most of it, which only resulted in getting walked on more. I made an appointment for a personal training session the next day in Livonia with **.On Saturday, 12/19, I went to the gym for training session. The only problem was there was some kind of breakdown in communication between the person who answered the phone and the trainer and my name was not on the schedule. Some other trainer said he was sorry and offered to make another appointment. No thanks. As I was leaving, I asked the person at the front desk to document in my account that I came in for a training session and the person wasn’t there. Evidently, this was ridiculous in her mind as she had already written someone somewhere a note. I finally became very agitated 2 weeks and $460 later and nada."

The general manager of a cubicle said he couldn't get the TVs fixed and there was a problem with the music system. I am trying to cancel membership. Yes, they said I should send a certified letter to Los Angeles to cancel. Dismal service and management, if any."
1489,218122,2009-12-21,,"My daughter, a college student, was pressured into signing up with a personal trainer for 12 months for $160 a month. Being a college student and out on her own for the first time, I'm sure she made the trainer's day when she walked in. She tried to get out of the contract when she started her student teaching, as she could not work during that semester, only to be told the best they could do is to put her contract on hold for 6 months. She did this and the day after her graduation, her bank account was hit with the $160 fee and she also had overdraft charges hit, as she thought she had one more month before she would be hit again with the fee. She quickly ended up in tears, having long since beat herself up for ever getting talked into a 12-month contract when she could not afford it. I decided to appeal to LA Fitness' sense of decency, which it turns out, they do not have. It quickly became obvious to me their business is run on pressure sales and total lack of customer service, not to mention lack of ethics or morals. They refuse to give out the corporate office number and I could not even find it on the internet. This, to me, is a huge red flag as to how they run their business, and that if it were not for pressure sales or binding unsuspecting targets to long-term contracts, they could not stay in business.Is this still America? Do we not try to protect our citizens from these types of business practices? Then I logged onto the internet and saw that, sadly, my daughter is not alone. It is disgusting to see all the people who have had terrible experiences with this company and nothing is done about it."
1490,218121,2009-12-18,,This place is a dump and must be cited by the health department. It is not clean. Waste basket full and the trash cans in the ladies' bathroom often overflows with sanitary pads! Machines are never cleaned and God forbid they are broken. It takes weeks to repair. A total dive and totally unsanitary! I am sure the health department will take action once they investigate.
1491,218120,2009-12-17,,"I complained to corporate a few months ago. They told me to complain through the manager from the gym. I left my number several times, there never was a response. This gym is the one located in the city of Downey, California (Firestone Blvd). There are a lot of cockroaches all over the locker. This gym needs people to keep up and clean the gym. I hope they can be able to clean it more often. In the morning, there is no person who does any cleaning at all."
1492,218119,2009-12-13,,"Send all complaints about LA Fitness directly to the Attorney General of California and ask that he make an investigation into their business practices. My experience is very like those already listed. Unfortunately, I didn't find these until after I was scammed (Fall 2009)."
1493,218118,2009-12-10,,"I've been trying to cancel this for 6 months. When they would not stop charging me monthly, I canceled the credit card they were billing. They just don't get it. I've talked to them on numerous occasions and even sent them a letter by registered mail and they keep sending the same stupid letter. It's like trying to explain something to a deaf person who doesn't sign and can't read. No matter what you do, they say ""okay"" and send you the same form letter. I could care less about trying to communicate with dolts, especially callous, non-caring dolts. I am, however, concerned that they will turn in a negative credit report against me. "
1494,218117,2009-12-09,,"There have been many different things that have happened, but now since Sunday, this club has no hot water so we are taking cold showers. All we hear is that the corporate is working on it. These people have no idea of customer service. If your payment is one day late, they make sure to ask you when you are entering how you are paying for it before admitting you. I can never get a straight answer from the corporate or anyone there. Frustrated."
1495,218116,2009-12-04,,"I lost hours at work and can no longer afford the training membership. They will not let me out of my contract. They suggested freezing my account. Feeling like I had no other choice, I agreed to do that. However, they were to freeze my account for 3 months. And surprise, surprise, they charged me anyways. I am so unhappy with LA Fitness and the tight hold they have on me with the contract. I understand contracts, but I don't understand how a company can hold you to the contract when you lose your job or hours at your job in this day and age. Give your customers a break, or you will lose them forever."
1496,218115,2009-11-27,,"Hello all, against my normal principles, I would ask you to circulate this email as widely as you can. I believe my son to have been cheated out of $200 and I believe that LA Fitness do the same things very often to lots of people. For this reason, it is my public duty to spread details of their unfair practices to as many potential victims as possible. Please read the details below and then, if you are happy to, copy the email to as many people in your address book as you are able. The more people who see this email, the fewer people will fall victim to this unfair dealing. Thank you very much. Are you thinking of joining an LA Fitness gym? Here are some details of our own recent experience to help you to decide one way or another. During my son's brief involvement with LA Fitness staff at our local branch, they lied to my son over the terms of contract, specifically terms of cancellation. They continually provided different answers to fob him off when he tried to cancel his membership, produced a version of the contract that they claim he signed which did not match the original version of which he had kept a copy. They refused to accept responsibility for comments and promises made (and the staff who made them) when he was persuaded to sign up. Subsequently, staff at head office allowed us to pay, under protest, a full and final cancellation fee but then attempted to collect further payments via direct debit.They passed the matter of the further payments over to a debt management company (with a vile and aggressive manner) within 5 days of the next payment apparently being due (it was later cancelled) and without any attempt at all to contact my son to ask why his direct debit arrangement had failed to pay out (he had been shrewd enough to cancel it). They promised to respond to my son's complaint within 14 days but took over 2 months to provide only a partial response.I cannot, of course, prove that any or all of the above represents LA Fitness' normal methods of doing business but a quick and easy internet search (try something like LA Fitness+complaints) will enable you to see the general pattern of their dealings with various other less-than-satisfied customers. My own advice, given without prejudice, would be to join a different gym."
1497,218114,2009-11-21,,"When I opened my account with LA Fitness, it was over the phone with a phone call. The manager was very polite, explained I did not need to come in to fill out any paperwork and I gave my debit card information over the phone. At the time, I was sick but I wanted to start a fitness program during the New Year. Once I started using LA Fitness, I was really disappointed. Even though the facilities are large and comfortable, with all the latest machines, there is not a soul to help you. Instead a bunch of ""suits"" sitting at their desks would consult with you on the additional benefits of using a personal trainer. No one would lift a finger to help you otherwise. For my monthly membership fee of $39.95, I expected a whole lot more. The atmosphere was unfriendly and cold. Even so, I kept my membership until I had an injury and could not go. Then I tried to cancel. As with others, I called first, and was told I had to go into the club to cancel membership. So then I went in to the club and got their cancellation form. I also went online and tried to cancel my membership there, which I thought I successfully did, just in case. Instead, I have been hounded and billed for two months now. I have had two overdraft fees ($35.00 each) and again my membership still has not been cancelled after all of that. If there is a class action law suit, count me in. It should be just as easy to cancel membership as it was to sign up. "
1498,218113,2009-11-21,,"I wish I had seen this site before I had signed up. I've been fighting with them for four months to receive $70+ back, for them charging my account for a month of service after I had already cancelled. They actually charged me for two months but argue about the date of cancellation and would only give me one month back. I've talked to the manager on several occasions and each time, she tells me she is working on it. She has used the excuse that I didn't send my stupid cancellation paper to corporate by certified mail. I don't think there is a corporate, but some basic answering service people in cubbies in a warehouse because you can never speak to anyone in management. You only get sent back to your stupid branch who isn't helping you. I'm contacting local media about this issue and hope to get my money back. I'll tell everyone not to join. Shame on this company for being so greedy. Karma will prevail. I'm out $140+ that I could use to pay bills. The economy has affected me negatively as it has so many and I can really use the money. Heck, that's the reason I cancelled my membership in the first place."
1499,218112,2009-11-14,,"When I signed up for the personal trainer program, I asked the man, ""Is this a contract?"" He told me no. Now that I want to cancel, they told me that I signed a contract and agreement that I had no idea about. I talked to the people at the gym, they said that there's nothing they can do. I asked for the corporate office number. I called and they were rude and not very helpful. I talked to 2 different people, a man named Kevin and a woman named Erin (who lied and said her name was Katrina). Kevin told me that there was nothing he could do so I asked to speak to someone over him. He told me he was it, there was no one over him. I called back and left a message on a Hispanic man's voice mail. A lady (Erin) called back. When I told her what happened she said that I signed an agreement (contract) and that there was nothing she could do. I was like, ""Even though I was tricked and misled by one of the workers?"" She said, ""You still signed,"" and hung up in my face. I called back talked to another. She said she was going to contact the VP in my area and send email but I haven't heard a response yet and that has been almost a week. And I was told I can cancel or stop anytime I want."
1500,218111,2009-11-12,,"My daughter and husband signed up for a monthly membership at LA Fitness. After 3 years (?), they wished to cancel their memberships. Trying to cancel their memberships has been a month long process that is still not resolved, with LA Fitness still still trying to debit our accounts for dues which is check card fraud. My husband used his business card for payment of monthly dues. Note, I have never had a membership or signed a contract authorizing electronic debits of my bank account. While on a one week vacation, my husband's card was lost and he canceled it. When we got home, we had literally dozens of phone messages (several each day) that we owed them money. These calls came from branches located across the Untied States from a different person each time. We called the Wilmot branch where they signed up originally and the staff told us they could do nothing without us coming in. When we got there and requested to immediately cancel the memberships, they said they can't do that. We had to send in forms via certified mail to cancel memberships. After discussing this issue with the operations manager Victoria ** for 30 minutes, I received cancellation forms for both memberships. The forms need to be received at least 10 days prior to close of the next billing cycle. This policy changed from when we signed up, with no written notice, which they admitted to. Long story short, I paid the one month ""past due"" amount of $25.49 for my daughter and mailed certified mail the cancellation notices on October 8, 2009. On Nov. 1, 2009, LA Fitness debited my account $25.49 for prepaid dues for November 2009! First, the membership had been cancelled and second, I did not authorize them to debit my account. After disputing this bill for weeks, they sent me an electronically generated email receipt dated October 7, 2009 (no signature) that says ""This confirms your authorization today for the one time charge on or after 10/8/2009 to the account ending (**) in the amount of $25.49."" Then the form says, ""In addition, you authorized the continuation of your regular monthly dues of $24.99 to be billed to your account resuming on 11/1/09."" They did not disclose this to me at the gym and I did not sign anything authorizing them to debit my account other than a one time charge. I did not receive a receipt other than the visa slip and they told me ""We are a paperless company""? I admit, I was stupid to pay with my debit card, but by debiting my account without authorization after the membership was cancelled is check card fraud. Any legitimate business issues receipts and written invoices when requested. I have filed a complaint with the Tucson Police Department Check Fraud Division, the AZ Attorney General's office, Bank of America Check Fraud Division. Is there an attorney willing to file a class action lawsuit against LA Fitness for fraudulent business practices? At the very least, they should lose their Visa privileges. I would very much appreciate any help your forum can provide to stop LA Fitness's criminal business practices. They must use this scam dozens or hundreds of times each week to extort money from consumers. They need to be held accountable. Good luck trying to pin them down or get anyone on the phone more than once."
1501,218110,2009-11-07,,"My husband and I met with representatives from LA Fitness related to a membership. We also discussed the personal trainer sessions. During our first meetings, we discussed my husband's multiple surgeries (spinal, cervical, knee replacement). We explained that we needed to make certain that there would be no contraindications to the program. We were assured that they would work with my husband. During the first session, Keith pushed my husband to the point where he was experiencing pain. We stopped the session and requested a modification. Keith backed off a bit but stated, ""No pain, no gain."" That was unacceptable. My husband returned for his second session, Keith was not available. Another trainer was going to work with him, but there was no hand off communication and the new trainer knew nothing of his medical conditions. I spoke with Matt, who assured me this would be addressed. After several sessions, to cut to the chase, my husband now has a herniated lumbar disk and is going to have surgery on 11/18/2009. We did cancel the personal trainer sessions, but that took several physician letters. Ultimately, we cancelled our membership. Not one person responded to my calls and I did stop by and Matt was not available. I hold them responsible for the pain my husband is in. How many others are there?"
1502,218109,2009-11-06,,"I was sold a membership at the Eldridge Road & West Little York Gym in 06/2009 and specifically requested a multi-state all gyms access, as I would be travelling for 6 weeks. I tried to use the membership at what they call a signature club in 09/2009, only to find out I had been sold a bill of goods and could not work out there unless I paid another $100 plus $20 per month. Look on the internet before you buy. This organization has more bad, disreputable stuff written about it than any health club I have belonged to in the past 20 years. I spoke with Shannon on the phone at corporate, and she was the typical recording and completely unwilling to further my call or help me out. She also told me at first there were no signature clubs in 06/2009. Then after she found out I told the manager I was travelling, she backed up and said there were no signature clubs in my area. More ""big corporate"" lies and extortion. It's typical. They do not care about the individual as long as they get a few more dollars. I will be cancelling my membership. And if you are smart, you will not join this lying bunch of thieves!"
1503,218108,2009-11-04,,"I joined Pro Results Training at La Fitness in January 2009. In mid-April, I found out that I had a herniated and degenerative disc in my lower back that would stop me from working out with the trainers. I then contacted the manager at the LA Fitness location, and he told me to submit a doctor's note to cancel the membership. I submitted the doctor's note, and the manager there never canceled my membership. As time went on, LA Fitness kept on charging my AmEx card $130 each month. Each month, I called up the manager and even went back to see him about the situation, hoping he would be taking care of it as he promised. He lied and did not stop the billing. I called AmEx and disputed all the charges. AmEx then contacted LA Fitness, and they submitted a signed copy of my contract. I contacted the local Tucker, GA club again and spoke to Amy, who submitted my doctor's note to corporate office. Then I called the corporate office to obtain my refund of $650. Now, they are only refunding $260 out of $650. LA Fitness Pro Results Training is a complete scam. They just know how to steal people's hard-earned money. I have also filed for a complaint with BBB. These people deserve to be sued and shut down!"
1504,218107,2009-11-03,,"I attempted to cancel my membership with LA Fitness without success. It's my understanding that LA Fitness has a problem with honoring their totally non needed mail in cancellation policy. I have contacted LA Fitness on several times over month in order to cancel the membership. I have been getting the runaround from the local office and the corporate office. They had no problem signing me up and taking my $180.00 initial start up fee which I will never see again. LA Fitness needs to readdress their cancellation policy which makes it easier for a consumer who has the right to cancel within the logical time frame. Since LA Fitness’s lack of respect for the cancellation, another payment was taken from my account. When I spoke to a representative at the corporate office, I was told that the transaction was canceled by my bank and would be returned in a couple of days. The representative misled me and the payment posted to my account. I don't believe LA Fitness has any intention on canceling my membership and I don't intend letting them get another dime from me.Since LA Fitness didn't honor their cancellation policy, my account was debited and therefore affecting my accounting for the month. LA Fitness is making tons of money from this non logical cancellation policy. Throughout the time of my membership, I barely use it so LA Fitness had months of payments on me for nothing. I want my payment for the month of November to be refunded and my membership canceled."
1505,218106,2009-10-30,,"On October 10th, 2009 (which was a Saturday), I went to the LA Fitness facility that I joined at to cancel my gym membership as well as to inquire for a refund of 25 paid training sessions. The person at the front desk told me there was no one from the management for me to talk to about the training side of my situation and he printed me out a cancel form for the gym membership and told me to mail it in. I was told management for the trainers would be back on Monday. I went back on Monday and was told I had to mail in my cancel request via registered, certified, return receipt. No problem, I did that on Tuesday, October 13th, since Monday was a holiday. As far as that goes, my membership has been cancelled due to a freak accident I had on Sept. 21st that resulted in the amputation of a toe. I have not been to the facility to use the personal training sessions since August of 2008 (I have other medical issues). Due to the situation, I asked if I might be able to obtain a refund for 25 paid sessions at $1,000.00 which have been paid for and not used due to my bad back on and off, and now this incident. I have been dealing with Mr. Joe **, Pro Results, gave him copies of the letter from the surgeon at the facility for over 2 weeks, with a response that came finally today after I had to call him numerous times. He told me that the regional person Esperanza ** for the area said no refund at all, no discussion no nothing. It is my understanding that you cannot use the training sessions if you do not belong to the gym. What am I to do? I am no longer a member and will not be returning to the gym due to money issues as well as doctor bills up the yin yang and Pro Results has $1,000.00 of my money. I am hoping that the powers that be will have a shred of mercy and find it in their hearts to refund me the money. Any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Once again I really appreciate your time and consideration regarding the above. No one could give a damn! It is oh well you are out of the money!"
1506,218105,2009-10-30,,The personal training program is a scam. They misrepresented the contract. They told me that I can cancel with no cancellation fee with 30 day notice. But I signed my savings away; it was a 12 month contract that can only be cancelled if I pay 50% of the 12 month contract. The managers are horrible; they said it was all my fault for not reading the contract when I put my trust on them to honestly represent the contract. Stay away!
1507,218104,2009-10-28,,"I joined LA Fitness in the beginning of June 2009 for a monthly fee of $34.99. While working out, I was approached by a fitness trainer (Josh) encouraging me to start training sessions because they have a great deal going on. For $160/month, I could have a trainer. So I swiped my Visa card, because they needed the $160 upfront for the month. I signed the black box for the Visa transaction. No contract was given to me nor was I told at that time that I was signing a contract or making a year commitment. When my signature for that Visa transaction went on the little black box, it actually went onto a contract which I found out (2) months later when my bank contacted me because my account was overdrawn. When I went to my bank, they gave me a printout of several transactions made by LA Fitness. The first swipe of my Visa card was not for $160, which they told me, but for $689. And they took an additional $500 twice in the month of June. In August, they deducted another $645. I went to my local LA Fitness, so they could fix this. There had to be some kind of mistake. The girls at the counter told me that I had a contract and I would need to talk to the person whom I signed up with. I told the ""girls"" at the counter that I didn't have a contract and I needed to speak with Josh. At this point, LA Fitness had $2,334.00 of my money. I would like to reiterate that I turned 18 a month prior, so this money was all I had. I work part-time and go to school. I waited 2 hours in LA Fitness that day for Josh. The date was August 17, 2009. He was in, but he was busy. I had to be at work, so I left. My mom called me to find out how I made out and did LA Fitness credit my account. When I told her what happened, she told me to be late for work and to meet her at LA Fitness. I went back to LA Fitness. My mom and I went up to the counter and asked to speak with Josh. My mom told the counter girls ""We are not waiting 2 hours."" We still waited about 30 minutes. Josh finally came out and took us to his desk. We asked to see a copy of the ""so-called contract."" He printed it out, and there was my signature - the signature that I made in the little black box the day I swiped my Visa card. This was the first I saw of this contract and of the amount of money LA Fitness was going to charge me per month. If I had seen the contract or been told of the actual facts in the contract, I no way would have signed it. This trainer had me sign a contract for training for $645.00 a month. I would never had been able to afford that, and if I could, I would never spend that amount for a trainer. I informed Josh at that time that he never gave me this contract. This was the first time I was able to read it. He informed us that he has 400 clients and gives everyone a copy of the contract. He explained he gave it to me when he gave me my trainer guide. I informed Josh that he did not give me the trainer guide. Nick, another trainer, gave it to me. Well, he then told my mom that he didn't give it to me the day I signed it but that he knew he gave it to me a few days later, which he did not. However, Josh still had a responsibility to present me with a copy at the time of signing and allow me to review the contract prior to signing, which was impossible because he wasn't even explaining that there was a contract.The buyer's right to cancel in the contract reads that you have three (3) days to cancel from the date of receiving a copy of the contract. At that time, I wanted to exercise my right to cancel it, because I received it on August 17, 2009. I told Josh this, and he informed me that it wasn't that easy and that I was 18 and bound by the contract. He would see what he could do. My mom asked to speak with his boss, and he informed us that he was his own boss and the general manager. He told my mom that he would see what he could do and call her back later that day. Josh never called back.I wrote a letter to corporate office to cancel the contract based on the buyer's right to cancel. I did it via certified mail, as it is stated in the contract. I told them they were no longer authorized to deduct money from my account. I also dropped a copy of the letter at the local LA Fitness, as the contract also suggested to do. When I did this, the local LA Fitness refused to accept the copy of the letter of cancellation.Keep in mind that I still have my monthly membership with LA Fitness that I have not cancelled at this time. A few days later, I entered LA Fitness to work out (not to use a trainer) with a friend of mine. The ""counter girls"" swiped my membership card, looked up at me, and told me ""Oh, you aren't allowed in here. You are negative energy."" So now, I am also paying for a membership I can't use.I received the certified card back, which was signed by the corporate office, and I gave them an additional ten (10) days to do what they need to do on their end. A follow-up phone call was made to a member service manager on September 2 to find out if they cancelled my contract and to find out about a refund, to no avail. The response was ""Well, the computer says that you signed a contract."" ""Well, the computer says that Josh did give you a copy of a contract.""My mom is now taking over this battle with them. Even during the dispute, they still continued to get money from my account. Josh knows that he didn't give me a contract nor tell me. As of this date from the month of June 2009 to October 2009, LA Fitness has $3084.00 of my money. Josh had a professional responsibility to explain the contents of the contract and provide me with a copy of the contract the day I supposedly signed it. If he would have done that, I would never had all these deductions made from my account.I filed a complaint with Visa to see if I could get my money back. So I have to wait and see, but my fight with LA Fitness is not over yet. I think I was taken advantage of, because I was young but yet old enough to be bound by a contract. And I'm even paying for something I can't even use. Even if they let me into the facility, I will never work out there ever again. I am now also trying to cancel by monthly membership, too.I do want to mention that I have not been in LA Fitness, since they told me I wasn't allowed in, and that has been since August 21, 2009. Yet, they keep trying to get my money. LA Fitness should be investigating how their trainers are signing people up. I believe there is a huge scam there. I also live in the state of Pennsylvania, and on the back of the contract under PA Health Club Act, if a client is not given a copy of the agreement, they can cancel it at any time. They ignore this right, too.One final note regarding this so-called professional general manager/trainer at my local LA Fitness: He was also my trainer, but after a few sessions with him, I switched trainers because he made me feel very uncomfortable. For lack of a better word, he was creeping on me. And he took my phone number from my file and kept texting me to hang out. That's not very professional.Corporate was made aware of this too. That was the only thing they were concerned about, not my contract nor my money. I have kept the texts just in case I have a chance to prove my case, and I hope that it will lessen Josh's credibility because I guess this is his word against mine. I have completely closed my bank account, so they will not be able to get another dime from there. But now, my credit is at risk and I'm only starting out in life."
1508,218103,2009-10-28,,"I and my fiance are seniors, and we went to LA Fitness to see what the club had to offer. Having bad knees, I needed a pole. We were shown around and then met with a salesman and club manager. Before we knew it, we had signed up for 4 sessions of training a month for 12 months. In my opinion, the trainers were not competent in working with seniors. Once, the trainer never showed and we had a session with a person who wasn't certified. We went for another session today, and there's no trainer. I called the manager, Johnny, and voiced my opinion. I told him that I wanted to cancel the rest of the sessions, and I thought because of the problems we had, I wouldn't be charged for 50% of the remaining months, which were eleven. He informed me that there's nothing he could do but terminate it for the 50% penalty. He never tried to work with me. My account was charged $660, which was 50% of the remaining balance. I feel we were highly pressured and they don't care anything about the customer but just make a sale and make their numbers!"
1509,218102,2009-10-27,,"I went to join LAF on 7/1/09 strictly for using the walking machines but Travis talked to me about Fitness and I then agreed to 4 sessions, thinking this would give me the opportunity to see how these machines worked. Also, I agreed to the $50 evaluation. I left there knowing that my Chase credit card would be charged $150 for 4 sessions and the evaluation. My monthly dues for the gym would be $32.46 which is what I agreed to. Charges for $150 and $32.46 were charged to my Chase Card. However, the next month, $100 showed up on the Chase card. I immediately went to the gym to speak with Travis (he was not with LAF anymore). Mike ** kept talking about Fitness and did not want to hear about the money situation. I instructed Chase to reverse charges. By now they have charged my account $300. Irvine sent Chase the contract that I signed for the 4 sessions but made it look like I approved 11 session thus I was owing $1100. The fraud was this: Travis pushed the electronic pad for me to sign. I signed. He then added to the second paragraph, ""11 payments at $100 ea."" I did not see what he entered. He printed the contract and folded it as he walked back from the printer and immediately stapled it to the inside back of a booklet."
1510,218101,2009-10-26,,"I sold a great opportunity as a ""military"" membership for my son to stay active and in shape while attending military school. That would ""freeze"" the account in the months that he was away for school or training. All was great for two years. In year 3, LA Fitness reinterpreted the policy (without notice) and told my son the account would freeze. In fact, the freezing was disallowed at the corporate club, as now only ""active duty personnel"" are being offered this plan. I have been charged nearly a year of dues as a result of LA Fitness changing the interpretation of this policy. Multiple calls and visits to the local and corporate clubs are useless, and the cancellation policy is conveniently only by mail and requires ""sufficient time before next billing - typically ten days"" to actually stop the stealing of funds from checking accounts!"
1511,218100,2009-10-24,,"I signed up for a gym membership in July of 2008 and put my account on freeze in October of 2008 because I was pregnant. LA Fitness continued to bill me every month despite repeated phone calls in Dec., Jan., Feb. & Mar. I asked for a refund & to cancel in March. Instead, they put my account on freeze for 6 months (till Sept. 2009) & continued to bill me. I tried to cancel online & the website stated, ""Please enter a valid member key tag & zip code to continue"". Then I went into a facility & I was told that I had to print my cancellation form online after I was instructed by the manager, John, at South Plainfield that I can go into any LA Fitness to request a cancellation form & mail it in. So how do I cancel? No one will let me cancel after I already cancelled in March! John's response to this was, ""You're wasting my time. I don't have time to deal with this."" He refused to refund me my money, and kept handing the phone to a different person. So every time I talked to someone, I had to re-explain the problem, and then they would say I have to talk to John, the manager. Issue #2: My husband started his LA Fitness membership on April 22, 2009. We were charged $150 enroll fee & 1st & last month membership fee for a total of $350, but there are no 1-yr. contracts. It's month to month. So that makes no sense to charge 1st and last month. Second, my husband's father signed up to LA Fitness on ""4/15/2009"" & was not charged an enrollment fee. Then, my sister-in-law went into LA Fitness the day after I signed Shane up with a friend & 1 of the sales associates offered her a promo. She said she wasn't interested. Then the sales associate told her that if she signed up, she'd get a promo for $0 enrollment fees. She said she would but lives out of state. When I called to find out why everyone else got a $0 enrollment fee but me, John, the manager (who signed us up) apologized and stated that he would call me back to take care of the refund for me. He never called back. When I called back 2 weeks later, the receptionist said she would forward the message. I called 3 more times during the succeeding months until October and he never returned my call. When I finally spoke with him in October after cancelling my membership, he claimed that my father-in-law signed up a week after my husband in May, when they had the $0 enrollment fee going on. I said, ""No, he didn't. He signed up only a couple days before us."" He said, ""I am looking at the account now, and he signed up 1 week after you, in May "" I said, ""If you are looking at the his account, then what's Shane's father's name?"" He didn't know, he asked for the name, looked up the account, and said that Shane's father signed up on 4/15/09 (which I am pretty sure is not true, I am almost positive that he signed up 2 days before Shane) and that there probably was a promo going on 1 week before we signed up. Then I asked him why was there a $0 enrollment promo going on 1 wk before Shane enrolled and 1 day after Shane signed up when you (John), especially when you (John) just said that in May there was a $0 enrollment fee promo going on? He said that was irrelevant and there was no way to prove that anyone offered my friend that promo and to ""stop wasting his time"". Then he put me on hold without saying anything to me and transferred me to someone else who could not do anything to address this situation. On top of that, I cancelled in October and they still charged me for October's fee.I want a refund for the enrollment fee, last month's membership charge, and for the charges made while my account was supposed to be frozen in Oct., Nov, Dec, Jan., Feb. and March of 2008. Also, I want the account to be cancelled immediately.LA Fitness then sent these receipts to my email:Receipt for Membership Cancellation: ""The following members are also cancelled: **. This confirms cancellation of your monthly dues membership. Your membership will expire on 12/24/2009 and includes application of your last month's prepaid dues.

I cancelled in October and they are still trying to scam me out of more money. I want my last month's payment paid back in full for both accounts. I was already charged for my last month for Shane, which is October. And I was incorrectly charged for my account from March-October when I cancelled in March and was frozen since October of 2008. The only fee they were entitled to was $25 every 3 months for the account being frozen from Oct 2008-March 2009."
1512,218099,2009-10-19,,"On 9/19/09, my wife called to ask if her membership could be transferred to my name. Jim ** wanted me to just come in and sign a contract. I never came in or acknowledged his offer. On 9/22/09, $69.98 was taken out of my account, $34.99 again on 10/22/09. I'm very upset. I feel as though this is identity theft. The only offer to me was one month free for my wife. My wife has cancelled her membership and so are her friends and mine."
1513,218098,2009-10-15,,"Just like anyone else, I decided that I wanted to get back into shape so I decided I was going to join a gym in the nearby area. I lived in Poway, California at the time where it was military-friendly and pretty close to my school in Mira Mesa, so this was a win-win situation for me being that I am a veteran. I ended up joining LA fitness and paid for a personal trainer, which cost me $312 a month and I had to pay an additional $34.99 a month to have access to the gym. A few months passed by and then I was ordered to be reactivated to come back to the marine corps for training. I told the LA Fitness rep that I will be in 29 Palms doing training for approximately 4-5 months, so I don't want to cancel my account but simply put it on hold. Being that it is a military-friendly community, he said they get that all the time so that should be no problem. Putting my account on freeze or on hold helped with all the administrative paperwork that was involved. Now I'm back from 29 Palms on 30 days vacation and now I have so much problems because of LA Fitness.They never placed my account on hold! I was being charged $312, plus the gym membership fee of $34.99 for those 4-5 months. Not only that, those charges that were unexpected put me negative with that Wells Fargo account each month and I was charged an overdraft fee each time of $35.00 because of LA Fitness. I tried calling my local gym after going online to only find out over $2,000 in charges was deducted (periodically each month totaling the $2,000). I was told that the LA rep no longer works for the company so maybe I might want to call the headquarters. I tried calling that number several times, then finally, after the 3rd day of trying to call, I got someone by the name of Forrest. I explained to him what had happened and he told me he would look into it and give me a call back a few days later. He never called back! So me being me, I thought he was just overwhelmed with work and that it totally slipped his mind (but in fact, they make little notes in their computer to track complaints or avoid them). I spoke to Forest and he told me that the LA Fitness rep took the wrong procedures in handling my case and that he's going to talk to his supervisor about the situation. In the meantime, send my military orders. I sent it to Forest at his fax. A week went by, nothing happened. I tried calling him again, no luck. I decided to call back Irvine headquarters. This time, I spoke with a guy by the name of Alex, which I was later told is the manager. He seemed like a guy who gives a ** about what was happening. I told him I wanted my refund back because this is just wrong. He claimed that there is nothing he can do for me; however, I do still have 87 sessions of personal training time with a trainer, being that they are paid sessions. I explained to him that things have changed for me and I'm on vacation for the time being because I just received orders deploying me to Iraq for 8 months in a couple of months. This conversation took place on 10/7/09. I asked him if I can give those personal training sessions to my girlfriend and he said sure. I told him I wanted to cancel my account for the gym and the personal trainer, that I sent Forest that fax with all my info which was on 10/1/09. He said that he sees in the system when I spoke to Forrest and that he was investigating the agreement with me at the local gym. I told him I was told to fax in the necessary paperwork so I don't get charged again before the next billing cycle, yet I was still charged $34.99 plus $322 (which was $10 more than I normally paid and those charges were deducted 16 days ahead of the normal time that LA Fitness would take funds from my account). He said it looks like it was late for something, which seems strange to me because they took the funds as they pleased, so how could I ever be late? After playing tennis (going back and forth), it was evident to me that a refund was out of the questions. According to Alex, he would have to wait until Monday to see if the payments were in fact deducted from my account because he can't see any charges coming from my account. I was told if I cancel my gym membership, I would no longer have access to the gym which would void my 87 sessions, which means my girlfriend might not be able to use them. But he will get back with me and find out if that's the case. Oh, my girl is a 24 Hour member so she would have to become a member to use those 87 sessions. Monday has passed, today is 10/14/09 Wednesday and I can't even get a hold of Alex. I've called him yesterday several times, giving him the benefit of doubt, and I've heard many excuses for reasons he can't make it to the phone. Oh, he is at lunch. Then he's with a client and the famous line of all, ""What's your number? We'll have him call you back."" I get nothing but runarounds! I would love to get pointed in the right direction to put a stop to such white collar crimes that LA Fitness has been doing to innocent people. So now, not only do I feel the military is screwing me over by trying to recall me back to go to Iraq to play bang bang shoot em up, but now I got to deal with something as simple as a gym membership that has turned into a complex process of cancellation. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
1514,218097,2009-10-05,,"My husband, my two sons and I have memberships at LA Fitness. We also pay monthly for two memberships to the Kids Club. In total, we pay $160 monthly in membership fees. I believe that this entitles me to a clean, secure, and conflict free workout environment with staff that supports this ideology. There have been numerous issues that have come up in the past years. Members are allowed to workout and lift weights in flip-flops, allowed to bring their 9-year-old kids to spin class, allowed to wear inappropriate gym attire. Men and boys are allowed to wear shorts and pants that expose their underwear and buttocks; members do not rack their weights, and the staff does not rack the weights that are left on equipment. I am a 36-year-old woman, and I had to take down 180 pounds of weight from the Smith Machine. While training in the free weight area, one must continuously step over dumbbells, barbells, and plates. The trainers walk around talking to each other, and if they are approached about any of these issues, they are reluctant to address them.I have asked three trainers in the past to please ask some boy/man to pull his pants up because they were so low his underwear/buttocks were showing. Three times, I was told no, that it's not their job, or that they didn't want to upset anyone. I was told I should say something to the person myself if I wanted. Well, I did just that and very nicely asked a man to please pull up his pants because his butt was showing. He did and apologized, and then his friend started calling me derogatory names and making threatening body motions towards me. My husband, who was nearby, stepped in and told him to stop. I was told by the gym manager that it was my fault. I should not have said anything to the man wearing his pants inappropriately. I should have told one of the staff members to tell him for me. When I told him of my past experiences in doing just that, he did not seem inclined to believe me. I believe that members should have to adhere to the dress code. It should not take another member to address either the staff or another member about dress code. That is the responsibility of the manager and staff to take up with members prior to it becoming an issue.My husband and I enjoy the spin classes offered at LA Fitness. The classes have become another point of contention. There are no posted rules about using iPods during class. Some of the instructors do not allow them but will allow cell phone use, texting, and earplugs. Also, there is no clear and hard rule about signing in for a spin class. Again, some classes people do, some classes they don't. There have been arguments over bikes when the classes are full. Again, there is nothing posted stating that members must sign in to take a spin class. Fortunately, this has not been an issue for me, it is simply an observation. I have to admit, I do not know the rules about children in the gym or in spin class, but there have been at least three children under the age of 10 in spin classes on a regular basis. I have seen a 10- or 11-year old boy on a spin bike during a period where there was not a class, wearing flip-flops with no parent in sight. After spinning for about 10 minutes, this child continued to wander around the gym, trying out various equipment, wearing flip-flops, with no parental supervision.For the last few months, I have only been attending the Sunday morning spin class. On today's date, my husband and I attended the 9:15 am class. We actually arrived at the spin room and started our workout at 8:45, so we could spin for 90 minutes. The class started, and there were two men on the bikes directly behind me and my husband. During the class, these two men were talking to each other and laughing, and playfully hitting each other. Although it was distracting, I did not say anything. The workout was intensifying, and the music was loud, and the instructor, since she was on the mike, was loud as well. Despite this, the two men behind me continued to talk and began talking so loud they were shouting above the music. The instructor said, ""Hey, if you can talk, you're not working hard enough."" I know this instructor, and particularly enjoy her classes. I knew this was her way of telling them to be quiet. Because they were talking so loud, they did not hear her. I turned around and said, ""Ssh,"" and turned back around. The man directly behind me raised his hand up and extended his middle finger to my back which was seen in the mirror.My husband got off his bike and walked over to the man and said, ""Don't flip off my wife."" The man apologized to my husband and we continued our workout. After the class, quite a few of the people in the class made a comment that the two men in the back were ** and that they were being very loud. A gentleman in the front row stated that he could hear them talking and laughing from where he was spinning. The friend of the man who flipped me off came over to me and told me that my husband threatened his friend, and that it was a liability. I asked what my husband said to threaten anyone, and he could not answer. He admitted that my husband did not say anything to threaten him, but that because he got off his bike and walked over to his friend, that was a threat. I stated that when a man, considerably larger than I, makes an obscene gesture such as flipping me off, I perceive that to be threatening, therefore I would expect that my husband would defend me. We all ended up speaking to the assistant manager. The man who flipped me off admitted that he has a criminal history, and because of that, if he were to hit anyone, he would go to prison. Despite this and despite the fact that he admitted to flipping me off when I shushed him (after the instructor tried to), the assistant manager told me that I could have been nicer when I asked them to be quiet, or asked the instructor to tell them to be quiet. I was dumbfounded.Once again, someone else displays bad behavior and I am told I am the cause of it. I cannot understand how it is that since the gym staff does not address behavior that is disruptive to the rest of the members, a member who dares to address it themselves is labeled as a troublemaker when another person displays bad manners and vulgar behavior. I have been a member of 24-Hour-Fitness for 14 years and have never had these issues there. I have spoken with friends and co-workers who attend the LA Fitness in Valencia, and they all stated that they do not see behavior like this there. I have continued to attend LA Fitness due to its convenient location. Unfortunately, due to these two incidents and LA Fitness staff reactions to these, I will no longer be a member."
1515,218096,2009-10-02,,"My boyfriend and I were both members of LA Fitness, and both accounts were charged to my credit card. We moved in December 2008, and there was not an LA Fitness nearby. I sent a letter (per the cancelation instructions listed on our contracts) to the corporate headquarters requesting that they cancel both accounts. I included both our names, account numbers, address, phone numbers, and e-mail address. LA Fitness canceled my boyfriend's account, but not mine. When I called and asked why they had not canceled my account, the (very rude) representative said that she had no idea; there weren't any notes in my account. I am still trying to have my account canceled at this point. As of today's date, LA Fitness has charged $279.92 of unauthorized charges to my credit card. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and hope to have a resolution soon, but I would recommend that others avoid LA Fitness at all costs."
1516,218095,2009-09-26,,"I bought a prepaid month-to-month program. I also purchased, for about $240, an additional set of 12-individual training sessions. I prepaid for the sessions with a Visa card I have on a special reserve account that I have for restoring my car. There is no activity on that account, nor has there been for a couple of years except LA Fitness who, when I went to close the account to get the money out that I'd saved to fix my car, had taken almost all of it, over $1,500! They wiped me out! Now they're dunning me for more! More? What the hell is going on? This was all prepaid! I am beside myself. I've been robbed."
1517,218094,2009-09-25,,"I have membership with LA fitness (Atlanta). I also set up a contract for personal training. I want to cancel my personal training contract, but I am being levied a penalty fee of 50% of what's left on the contract. I do not feel I should have to pay this since this was never discussed with me at signing, but it does say in fine print in the agreement. This is another case of lack of ""full disclosure"" on the part of LA Fitness. Do I have any reprieve here? The reason why I want to cancel the personal training contract is that it is too expensive and I cannot seem to be able to find a suitable time to schedule a session with the personal trainer. I don't want to have to deal with this any longer. It is too stressful."
1518,218093,2009-09-25,,"For the third time, first in May by my daughter Reagan and second in July by me, using my power of attorney on her behalf, we request you to cancel her membership. If you ever charge her Discover Card again, I will find a lawyer willing to take up a class action lawsuit on her behalf and others you have defrauded. As you might want to refresh your memory, I sent you proof that Reagan is supporting our troops in Iraq, a pretty compelling explanation of why she could not possibly avail herself of her former gym membership or use her personal trainer. I am once again including a copy of my power of attorney. The above is the letter that I am today sending to their corporate headquarters on PO Box 55088, Irving, CA 92619; and I'm sending a second copy by certified mail to LA Fitness on 2950 West Ina Road, Tucson, AZ 85741."
1519,218092,2009-09-03,,"LA Fitness: what a scam! I signed up for a multi-club membership with Rolando in August of 2009. After a few days, I went to another location to work out where I was informed I was only allowed to work out in Pembroke Pines - any other location would be $5 per workout. That is where I realized I was scammed! When I sat down to sign up, I never saw a contract. What I thought was a signature pin pad for my credit card was actually my signature that was electronically transferred to a contract! My story is the same as everybody's. I tried to call corporate - no answers. Finally, I sent a letter from the USPS (the employee behind the desk saw my form for LA Fitness and said it took him 1 year to cancel!) and called over and over until I threatened legal action and the manager cancelled my membership. I think it was pure luck. Fortunately, I use AMEX and they stood behind me. Good luck!"
1520,218091,2009-09-02,,"I joined this new club in April 2009, along with my four roommates. What a disaster. The hot tub and sauna are always being repaired, the pool is always too cold to use, and the locker room smells like it hasn't been cleaned since the 1920's. The place is less than six months old and already falling apart. That's just the beginning. The customer service at the club and the Irvine CA office (949 number) is atrocious. I can't remember one time at the club where the front desk girls stopped their texting, gabbing, or telephone conversations long enough to greet me and swipe my key FOB. And nobody in the entire company appears to be over the age of 20. All five of us were talking at home one day and discovered we were having the same problems. So we went in and spoke to the gym manager (picture 1980's Jersey girl with big hair, tight clothes, and her breasts almost hanging out). This girl sat there and didn't address a single concern. Eventually, I had to cancel my membership after being out of work for more than six months. What a pain that was. I went to the gym. They said call corporate; they can't do cancellations. Why not? They signed me up. Why can't they un-sign me? The corporate customer service reps were terrible. The half that can speak English were clueless, and they all suggested I go back to my club to cancel. Then there is the 20-day notice policy. Twenty days for what? In this day and age, this can be done within a matter of seconds. What do they need 20 days for? To bill you for one more month, that's why.So, I finally changed my bank account information, as I am moving back to the West Coast. Now I am getting calls 10-15 times a week to collect on dues that should have been cancelled, according to their own policies, several months ago. I actually have to change my cell number. I was a member of 24-Hour Fitness in CA, AZ, and NV for 8 years. I never had a single issue with them ever about anything. I cannot wait to go back there."
1521,218090,2009-08-31,,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I thought I was old and wise enough to know this and to trust my gut when it screams no! But I fell for the promise of ""free training sessions"" if I signed up. I even fell for the high pressure pitch when I said I wanted to think about it. ""I may not want to make you the same offer tomorrow,"" I feel violated! This predator must have had a sales quota and saw me coming! I probably told this personal training manager at the San Marcos, CA club 10 times or more that I had no income and was using a small amount of savings for a few months to get in shape for an upcoming job on a sailboat. He assured me that I could cancel my contract anytime and the automatic payments would stop. All I had to do is come talk to him when I wanted to cancel and he would take care of it. I questioned a few things in the contract, that I admittedly did not read all that well, and he kept assuring me not to worry about it. Like an idiot, I trusted him. I had put on some weight and had fallen off my workout routine. I was feeling flabby and out of shape, and must have appeared as vulnerable as I felt. This personal training ""manager"" did give me a few ""free"" sessions and I also got the lame half hour, one I supposedly paid for. I never really felt my needs were being met, but figured this will come in time. After the first month, I realized I was better off physically and financially on my own and went to him for guidance as he instructed. He rather callously handed me a piece of paper and told me to send it in and everything would be okay. Again, I believed him. A few days later, I received what appeared to be an email confirmation, so I felt okay. What I did not see, because my trusting nature refused to see it, was that the effective date was almost a year later! Imagine my surprise, anger, frustration and fear when I saw that another $39.00 had been debited from my seriously depleted bank account! After several persistent calls and some rather rude comments from the operations manager of the club, I was told that the VP agreed to cancel my contract, effective immediately, but that I would not receive any refunds. As of today, August 31, 2009, I have not received the promised email confirmation and am in the process of writing to this operations manager, the VP and the president of LA Fitness. I also canceled my debit card so hopefully, that will keep these sharks out of my bank account. I have expert legal advice from some very good friends, who happen to specialize in class actions. One of them just settled a huge consumer case and is looking for another cause to champion. Maybe this will be the one!"
1522,218089,2009-08-30,2,"I joined LA Fitness in January 2009 to use the pool only after a cervical fusion with titanium plate in my neck. I cannot use any gym equipment. I froze my membership in for June-September, as I was having more pain and had another opinion from a neurosurgeon. It turned out the bone graft was not fusing after an August 13 MRI. I called LA Fitness before the billing cycle to extend the ""freeze"" (I already paid $25.00 to freeze my membership in June 2009.). Now they say I have to pay $25.00 plus tax every 3 months that it remains frozen. Nothing was stated in word or writing that this freeze is only good for 3 months. Plus, they tax a freeze? I did not pull a muscle or get too lazy to work out. I have the MRI for proof, and yet, they just billed me after I hung up the phone and got an email. Another $25.00 has been taken from my credit card. I asked for a manager to call me back. I was the victim of a DUI accident, and my injury is severe. LA Fitness has unethical practices, and why you need to freeze your account should be done in a fair manner. Bally's used to freeze your membership for as long as you needed. They never continued billing you for something you are not using nor was there a $170.00 start-up fee. I may go to small claims court with my contract and my surgery notes and recent MRI and see what the judge says."
1523,218088,2009-08-21,,"After going through what I have been through in trying to cancel my membership with LA Fitness, it came to my mind that most certainly, I cannot be the only person who has gone through this! With the LA Fitness ridiculous membership cancellation policy, it is very obvious the company is trying to milk their customers for every last nickel they can before they leave. If you want to cancel your membership, would it not be logical to just go to your local LA Fitness and sign some paperwork after presenting ID and then you would be done? It sounds perfectly logical, right? You signed up that way. Why can't you cancel that way? If not, perhaps, over the phone. If not, perhaps online. Well, you can't. You have to go through a procedure by which you have to put your name and bar code and write cancel on a piece of paper and send it into a P.O. Box in Irvine, CA. If you want to be really official, there is a form that you have to get at your local LA Fitness where you basically put that information and send it in. Yes, you have to get it at the local LA Fitness. They won't even fax it to you! And if you do go there to pick it up, they won't let you fill it out and hand it to them so they can either mail it or fax it to corporate. You have to do it. I thought it was such a ridiculous procedure that I called the corporate customer service number. When I eventually got someone on the line, they verified that I didn't have to necessarily get the form but that I did have to sent in the letter in the mail with my very simple information on it. He said he would note my account to not bill any further and then recommended that I send it in ASAP, which I did. He said I had plenty of time to not be billed on the 17th as I always did as it was over 2 weeks away.As I describe this, keep in mind why their procedure might be like this. Multiply how many people they do this to on any given day that will not bother going through all I am going through to get satisfaction because of the relatively small amount of money this is. Do this to enough people, it adds up! If you had a simple and logical cancellation procedure, God forbid, you couldn't get the extra $30-$40 a month times however many people trying to cancel at any given time.After realizing there was no easy and logical way to quit LA Fitness, I followed their ridiculous procedure as mentioned earlier. Even though I did this, my monthly withdrawal was taken out anyways almost 2 weeks later. So, I tried to call corporate about it, because that was where I sent the envelope. It makes sense, right? Remember, the local club wants you to come in and pick up a form and fill out, but you can't give it to them; you have to mail it to corporate. You would think corporate would handle the situation. But they don't. It takes forever to get someone on the phone, and all they will tell you is that they didn't receive the envelope and they in fact did not notate the account as they said they did from the call 2 weeks earlier. And if you prod them to help you by escalating the situation, they will refer you back to your local club, who pawned you off on corporate in the first place.Well, I dealt with Mike at the Sorrento Valley Branch in San Diego, and like all other so-called ""managers,"" he is probably in his 20s and could care less about anything, except getting the next member signed up. Still, he acted like he cared and would ""see what he could do,"" since he believed me when I said I followed the procedure because I knew exactly what it was and I had dates and times. Well, he said he would get back to me the next day. I heard nothing. So, I called him the day after and asked him what was up. He said he hadn't called me, because he was working on it and hadn't got the answer he was looking for yet. I said, ""What is that supposed to mean?""He basically said he talked to some regional manager named Derek, and Derek so far wasn't looking to cooperate. Mike literally said though that he would keep working on it. I asked him ""What does that mean, you will keep on working on it?"" What will you do differently than what you have done already to get a different result? He said he will keep talking to Derek and see what he can do. Now, to those readers out there, I ask you, does that make any sense? I have a short story as to my plight. Mike tells the plight to his regional manager Derek, and Derek couldn't make a decision to help me. And Mike's plan is to keep telling him the same thing over and over day after day in the hope Derek changes his mind. I asked Mike if I was mistaken or whether this was in fact his plan, and Mike said yes, that was basically his plan. That is a true story as this all is of course!I told him that didn't sound like much of a plan, and I asked him for Derek's number. He wouldn't give it to me. I asked him for a number of anyone who had the power to help me, and he said it was Derek, whose number he would not give me. And he reminded me he would keep trying. He said that I might try the customer service number again. Yes, He actually said thatSo what the heck. I don't know if I am just a ** or what, but I did. After being on hold forever, Erin answered the phone and I explained to her my plight. She literally asked, ""Did you send your envelope in ""certified mail?"" Yes. She asked that. To try to quit LA Fitness, I not only can't do it right at my local club, or any branch club, which seems incredibly logical and rational. But now, she is asking if I sent my cancellation in via certified mail! Notice that in all my conversations previously in trying to cancel, that was never recommended.Obviously, since I am not exactly trying to broker a peace deal for the Middle East, it is beyond ridiculous to even consider having to use certified mail. But apparently, they have in their policies and procedures manual under ""Pissed off customer trying to cancel and followed procedures already."" Ask the customer if they sent in the cancellation via certified mail! See how they respond to that! If they get more pissed off, refer them back to the local branch.Truly beyond reproach at this point. I ask her if I can speak to a manager. She said she was a manager. Mind you, she sounds like she is 22 years old and acts like it too. I ask her if I can speak to someone above her who can help me, and she said there is no one like that whom I can speak to. She desperately tried to refer me back to my local club again. Yes. This is the loop I am in. Welcome to the LA Fitness cancellation process. Good luck with it. This is for a lousy $33 but for me, it is about the principle of the matter. I don't care if it is $5.After what I was going through, I KNEW there had to be massive complaints just like mine online, and sure enough, there is and after reading them, I realize there are many of you like me that just want to live in a world of decent morals and principles and when it is not happening, we have to do what we can to stop it.Shame on LA Fitness for screwing people!"
1524,218087,2009-08-07,,"I was doing my normal run of exercises one day and a friendly trainer approached me and offered me a ""great"" trainer program that they were having, where for about $400, I would get 12 months’ worth of training with a trainer, meeting with him once a week. To make the long story short, I asked them to please split the cost in two halves and asked them, ""Is this the only charge I need to make?"" and they said, “Oh yeah! We'll even give you 8 free classes so it is great offer for you."" So there I go, believing what they said and swiped my card thinking $400 for a full year of meeting the trainer once a week is pretty okay. Anyways, it turns out that they didn't give me a written contract, because they said, “It wasn't necessary,” and now I'm getting charged $156 every month. I called to get the issue resolved, and the same manager talked to me as I was some sort of useless bug, telling me that he can't cancel anything because it is a contract and now I'm stuck with 12 months of $156 a month for practically no services at all. And that's in addition to the $29.99 monthly payments I have. I am now waiting for a call from their California VP Mr. John Hall which I did today, by calling 949-255-7200 and which I'm guessing I will never get. I feel used, tricked and I'm very mad.The same guy that was all flowery talking that day has now turned into a major jerk brushing me off as a fly, when he was the one that misled me into this contract, which I didn't get a copy of, and was never really explained that it was a monthly charge. I asked him twice about the charge being a one-time fee and he said, ""Yeah, no worries buddy,"" and now he tells me the contract is $156 a month. I can't afford that, and I'm going to have a negative report in my credit report if I can't get rid of that charge. Attorneys, is there anything I can do? I can't believe citizens can get tricked and lured into these things, and there is nothing us consumers can do against them. I don't blame the institution, but the people that work there. They are all crooks, and unhelpful and after they get your credit card, they treat you as trash."
1525,218086,2009-08-04,,"On November 16, 2008 I signed up for a month to month membership with LA Fitness d/b/a Pro Results. On December 2nd 2008, I signed up for a fixed amount of two (2) half-hour training sessions per month for six months. At that time, I expected to leave the area within six months. I expressed this concern during the signing of my training membership and was reassured that the agreement only lasted for the duration of 6 months. During the course of these six months, I was extremely dissatisfied with the service at LA Fitness. Several trainers caused me extreme pain and discomfort. The trainers that did not, were overbooked. Given this difficulty in scheduling, my training sessions continued to accumulate. Moreover, early in July, I noticed additional sessions beyond the total of 12 I had signed for. At that time, I had a total of 8 remaining sessions. However, according to my calculations, if the agreement were to have properly expired on June 2nd, 2008, I should only have 6 remaining sessions. When I inquired into this, I was informed that my fixed agreement had converted to a month-to-month. When I reviewed my agreement, it included two (2) clauses that referred to the duration of the agreement being 6 months. The program fees table described above that specified 12 total sessions; the service type table that specified 0 additional sessions; a payment schedule clause that specified “5 payments of $88.00 (plus tax) are due on the 1 of each month beginning 01/01/09”. However, the agreement did include one (1) sentence stating that the agreement would turn into a month- to-month in the absence of 30 day notice of cancellation. My attention was not brought to this sentence at the signing of the agreement. Given the information provided, I fully believed that the agreement would expire at the end of the six month term with 12 total sessions purchased. Once my attention was brought to this term, I submitted the notice of cancellation for both the training sessions and club membership during the second week of July. However, LA Fitness informed me that because my cancellation was received after the billing date, I owed $88.00 for two additional training sessions. Although I expressed my dissatisfaction, LA Fitness refused to accommodate my concerns and demanded payment. I provided a check for the amount due on July 19th. On August 3rd, I received a phone call that because my club membership cancellation was also processed on the billing date of July 16th, I owed $39.99 for an additional month of membership. Given my aggravation with LA Fitness, I refuse to pay this remaining amount, relinquishing my privileges to membership.Given the information described above, I strongly feel the training agreement was misrepresented to me. I am seeking a reimbursement for all training sessions paid for but not redeemed beyond the fixed 12 sessions I signed up for. This amount being $176.00 for four (4) sessions billed the month of July and August. Currently, I have nine (9) sessions left to redeem. Should my request be met, this will leave a total of five (5) sessions to redeem. However, I am unable to redeem these sessions without clearing the outstanding $39.99 due for my membership. I am concerned that even if I pay the fee, I will be unable to redeem all of these sessions before the expiration of my membership on September 16, 2009. For this reason, I am also requesting permission to redeem any outstanding sessions after the expiration of my membership on September 16, 2009; to use LA Fitness’ facilities strictly for the purpose of redeeming those sessions after the expiration of my membership. Consequences: 9 outstanding training sessions that I may be unable to redeem. Extreme aggravation plus loss of time."
1526,218085,2009-08-02,,"I'd like to alert DFW to LA Fitness and its Pro Results Training program. To say the least, it is a company built on lies, commission hungry trainers, and backwards contracts that you are bullied into signing. I signed up for training sessions at LA Fitness in February so that I would be ready for a beach vacation in May. I signed a contract for 6 months, only six months, was told it was 6 months - period, the end. The company is now continuing to charge me $160 per month because, as I've now been told, my contract ""changed"" to month-to-month without my knowledge, despite the promise that it would be terminated in July. I've told many people at the gym who hassled me to sign for more sessions that, ""No, I cannot, will not."" I work weekends only and my last paycheck wasn't even $160 (My bank account has now been overdrawn by more than $50, and the money I have in savings for school is being used to cover my charges).Unfortunately, I was rushed to sign my contract and the guy ""explained everything on it"" in 20 seconds. No exaggeration. I have noticed, over my time working out there, that the ""black-shirts"" - the people in charge of signing up new people - literally prey on the same kinds of people, people who are a just little overweight, who always do the same workout, people who might be ""desperate"" to look good. I was just really wanting to get in shape for the beach, and I approached them. I told them I couldn't pay the $60 per session, so ""Poof,"" they magically gave it to me for $40/session. Then, I was told there wouldn't be any ""specials"" on training for 6 months, and I'd be allowed to completely cancel my sessions within 3 days. Well, 4 days later, they ran a ""no start up fee"" special which would have saved me $160. I couldn't get that money back. When any of the ""black-shirts"" approached me later, I would tell them, ""Oh, I've already got a trainer,"" and they would immediately walk off, despite how excited and happy they appeared to talk to me only moments before. The guy who signed me up never spoke to me again and acted like he didn't know me. I'd like to mention that he is actually no longer working at the Keller LA Fitness. I am also in their system under 2 last names. ** is my boyfriend's last name, and I have told them monthly that my last name is **, yet they keep ""forgetting"" to change it, and the people at the corporate office seem to think it is a huge problem that someone with the same ID tag for the club can have two different last names.When writing to the DFW BBB, I noticed every other complaint (probably 50-75 complaints for the Keller, TX gym alone!) was for exactly what I am writing over. I literally feel like I have had my credit card stolen and there is nothing I can do about it. Of course, I've learned my lesson now, but I think others need to hear about these false advertisements and dirty schemes before more people end up hurt by their lies. The trainers there aren't even good - I got an injury in my back one week before my vacation because my trainer told me I could lift more weight than I could. I am planning on reporting to my bank what I feel is an ""illegal"" charge to my credit card first thing Monday morning. Like I said, I am a college student. Had it not been for my gracious parents allowing me to live at home for a while, I probably wouldn't be able to eat for 2 weeks until I got my next check. In fact, after I've spent these $1300 on training, I'd rather have spent it on $1300 of chocolate. It would have made me happier."
1527,218084,2009-08-02,,"I was pressured into a personal trainer contract for $210 a month. I told the trainer I could not afford it; he said I could afford it if I gave up not buying lunch, stop buying clothes, etc. I asked if I could cancel any time and was told yes. I would be charged for another month after cancelling. I signed up in Sept. 2008 and set up times for trainer to meet me. He would call and cancel sessions and make it not convenient for me. So in January 2009, I got a cancellation form from New Hyde Park LA Fitness and mailed in return receipt. I received email confirming cancellation. I was charged another month and then for two more. I reported it to my credit card company and they returned it back to LA Fitness. LA Fitness then sent through another charge and sent through contract I signed. I signed an electronic box and saw no contract until Chase Bank sent it to me and said I had to pay for one year. I closed my credit card and then they sent me letter that they would report me to a collection agency. When I called in, they said I can buy it out for $735. My mother, Harriet **, was lending me money for buy out, but every time I called, they said the charged on credit card did not reject. Another week went by and then buy out went to $850. My mom called corporate office and talked to Alicia at 425-379-9703 and she charged my mom's credit card $850 and my mom was told it was ended. The next day, another $210 was charged. I called again and they said I still did not pay up, even though Alicia emailed that I was paid. In total, $1,060 was charged to my mother's card, which I paid back to her since. This is deceptive trade practices, not full disclosure, electronic box signed. I never saw the contract. I did not want to be sent to a collection agency, so my mom paid it. I would like to get refund on the $1060. We have all documentation on credit cards and threatening collection letters and copy of contract with electronic signature. I hope you can help."
1528,218083,2009-07-31,,"I joined LA Fitness at North Miami Beach (located on Miami Gardens Drive) 2 months ago and used it barely for a week. The place is filthy and you can faint from the bad odor in the male’s locker room. The rugs are full with gums that turned black after the place was not vacuum steamed for ages. I am afraid to walk barefoot there knowing that they are not cleaning the rugs least I get foot illness. There is potentially something wrong with the air circulation there and they refuse to fix the problem although they keep telling you we are going to take care of that. I spoke with cuter service in my location, a week later with the assistant manager, then with the manager, then with the national number, all tell you what you want to hear and absolutely nothing was done to mediate the problem. I can’t understand this. It will eventually bite them back when more and more people find out that they are not what they try to sell. They surely don’t fulfill their promises to their customers during registration. “Oh, any problem you have, don’t worry, come to me and all will be taken care of, after all we are happy when you are happy.” And when you do actually need them, forget it, they are so busy into fooling new customers to join, that they totally don’t care if the place rat. With all the complains against LA Fitness, a good and vigorous lawyer will be able to pull here a very hefty class action lawsuit for misrepresentation and perhaps even fraud. Please be careful, they are very smooth in pulling you in and all somehow looks good when you are eager to join, but then you find out the truth. Be careful!"
1529,218082,2009-07-29,,"I signed up for an LA fitness membership on 7/22/2009. I was given a contract by the sales representative for a multi-club membership, zero initiation fee, and $34.99 a month. The contract was given to me and I accepted the terms and gave them a credit card for payment. LA Fitness informed me that they were going to give me a 7-day pass and I was to return after the pass expired to initiate my membership. I returned on 7/29/2009 and spoke to the representative (Ray **; phone number **). He informed me that they would not be able to honor the rate given to me on 7/22/2009, even though I have a contract executed by both parties for the aforementioned rate. They informed me that the rate that they offered ""did not get approved,” even though they offered it to me, put it in a contact, and accepted my credit card information. The manager at this location did not offer any remedy when I said that I would not accept a higher rate. I called the corporate office and spoke to Nina who offered little to no assistance. She informed me that even though I had a contract, they would not honor that rate. In summary, I requested that they honor the contract and they refused to. They wanted more money for the membership. "
1530,218081,2009-07-21,,"I was told in Northridge, CA that I could not cancel my membership there because I was on a ""renewal"" and had to cancel through corporate. I was told to show proof of my new address via a bill. I sent it certified mail on 7/6 and it was received on 7/9. A week later, I called to ask the status and Christine claimed they had never received it. I told her I had confirmation from the USPS that it had been received. She then demanded I fax her the proof of my certified receipt and a bill with my new address. After several attempts at calling and leaving messages, I have yet to hear back from her and receive my money. I wonder how much longer this will go on? I'm not sure I will ever return to an L.A. Fitness in the future. They still owe me hundreds of dollars, and have wasted my time by stalling and having me fax all the information I had already submitted via certified mail. I am so annoyed!"
1531,218080,2009-07-16,,"My wife and I live and West Haven. We happen to stop by LA Fitness and look around. We thought it was a good gym. We thought everything sounded right. We thought the people were nice. We were dead wrong. We spoke to David and Joseph **. They're two of the managers in charge of the place. David, the fitness regional manager in charge of nothing, baited us with the ""Employee Appreciation Day"". We were pressured into getting a free session with a trainer. David told my wife and I that he needed some basic information to start the process, but nothing would be charged. I checked my finances two days later and they put a hold on my checking account for $127. I paid the initial activation fee of $149, then dues for $159, then another monthly fee for $39.99. From the very beginning, this place was a scam. I can't believe I got suckered. Now I had to cancel my account because they overdrafted my account 2 times. They continuously put holds then return money without regard. I have my statements to prove it. I had to call the state Attorney General and put this place on blast! Please don't sign up. Stay away!"
1532,218079,2009-07-07,,"I was a member for the past 3 years, always paying on time even when I only used them 3 times in a year. Recently, my work reduced my hours and consequently no job, so I canceled my membership by a written letter as requested in the contract with 30 days notice. They threatened me to send me to collections, so I paid 3 more months and sent a letter to cancel the service. Today, I received a letter with no signature saying invoice statement ** with outstanding balance of $42.44. This is crazy. I don't have hours or money to pay this people for a service that I cancelled a while ago and that I haven't used in 12 months. I am really stressed about this because I did everything and more, but these people plays with collections and my credit is the only thing I have. They need to honor their commitment of 30 days notice to CXL policy with no more charges. I feel not being able to fight back because they put you on hold and don't even sign the letters that they sent you.I am really stressed about this situation. I don't have more money to pay and makes me angry to see these people trying to collect money when they don't provide service, and they can check their system to see I haven't used them in a long time."
1533,218078,2009-07-06,,"I was thinking that I was the only person who had experienced such a horrible time in trying to cancel my membership with LA Fitness. I was thinking of joining again. However, my experience was equally as bad as trying to cancel. I needed to cancel, because my work schedule no longer allowed me to work out in the mornings. Boy, was this a mistake. First of all, I alerted the trainer who I worked with first, then the front desk. To make a long story short, I had to cancel the credit card in order to stop the charges. How can they get away with this?"
1534,218077,2009-06-05,,"My trainer disregarded my letting him know certain exercises would hurt my injured back from a hit and run accident as pedestrian. He kept saying my back needs to be strengthened. I kept telling him the exercises hurt. There is much more to tell about sexual harassment I wish to speak privately with an attorney about. I am unable to stand up straight. I now have sciatica and severe back pain. I can't work. I can't sit on the toilet, get in and out of a chair, my car, and walking is very painful."
1535,218076,2009-06-05,,"Very bad service, rude employees, filthy gym, rude to guest who wanted to use a guest pass. I wanted them to explain why there was no way my guest couldn't use a pass simply because her license was from out of state. I felt threatened. The employees couldn't care less about the member's satisfaction. They said I should quit the gym. The manager yelled at me not to raise my voice with him and threw a form at me. I am a small girl, 100 pounds, and he was a large man 200+. I felt intimidated and scared."
1536,218075,2009-06-03,,"Anyone thinking about joining the LA Fitness in York, PA, beware! Their business practices are very deceptive. They rope you in with attractive offers and tell you that you can cancel your membership at any time, but when you really need to cancel, the story changes. They pull the ""bait and switch"" where they offer you one price and a set of conditions but when you go to sign the contract, the price is a lot more and the conditions are much more limiting. So be careful of what you are signing and by no means trust them when they say to you ""Trust me, I was given permission by my boss to give you this great deal today, but it’s only for today so you have to jump on it quickly.” It’s all a lie and you will be screwed!The trainers are inexperienced and their turnover rate is high. So if you've purchased a personal training package, don't expect to see the same trainer much of the time. Don't expect that the personal training package you purchased will be tailored to your needs so if you have any kind of special circumstances that need some attention (injury for e.g.), don't expect your trainer to care.The trainers, who do have some experience, do not show up for scheduled sessions that are already paid for. And don't, I repeat, don't even try to express any of your concerns to the management team because you will be ignored and if you pursue it further, you will be called a ** and will be threatened to have the police called on you. You may even be threatened to be punched in the face by that manager. And he may enlist other members to do so if he realizes that he cannot do so himself.Take for example, this past Friday May 29, 2009, my trainer didn't show up for my scheduled session at the York, PA LA Fitness. I didn't even get a phone call or any message saying that my session was cancelled. I showed up and my trainer is nowhere to be found. The other staff paged and paged him with no response. After a while, I became impatient and asked the staff to page the manager. The manager came and started giving me dirty looks, hissed and stormed off calling me a **. I have to reiterate this; I went to talk to the manager about my missing trainer and I was called a ** for bothering him with my concerns. I went to another staff person who identified himself as the new ""general manager"" and told him about the disrespectful way I was treated by the other manager. The new GM completely ignored me. He walked away to talk to other people, I'm now ** because I've already paid for the service that I'm currently not receiving. I am the paying customer and I'm being treated like a freeloader. Like any other paying customer, I confronted him about the way I was being treated and he threatened to punch me in the face."
1537,218074,2009-06-01,,"Believe nothing from the entry level liars at LA Fitness or management. They said I could cancel in three days, however, they still charged my card for two months. Afterwards, they said no problem, however, three more months were charged with me going in person and calling the national head quarters to no avail, simply no help. So I contacted the BBB and bingo and all five months were returned."
1538,218073,2009-05-20,,"LA Fitness in Temecula CA fails to enforce its policy of no locker occupancy overnight. As a result of many lockers being occupied 24/7, the locker rooms are so smelly that I change on the pool deck prior to my workout. In addition, they have cut their cleaning staff so that all guests/members coming at the time of opening (5 am weekdays and 8 am weekends) are subjected to bathroom facilities with urine on the floor, fecal matter in the toilets, urine on the toilet seats and urinals containing urine from the night before. As you can imagine, both the visual aspect and the smell is horrendous. Not to mention, the lack of sanitation is appalling. With concerns in society today about bodily fluids, I am shocked that the cleaners now don't arrive until 11 am."
1539,218072,2009-05-20,,"All complaints mentioned on this website, I have experienced with San Marcos, California's LA Fitness. I had trouble with trainers billing me for sessions I had canceled, saying I should have called the trainer's cell phone and not just left a message at the desk. The trainers all had different approaches so if one left and another one picked up my schedule, there was no consistency. Once I paid the full 1/2 hour fee while he measured me. Who needs to pay $38 bucks to be measured? The trainers, in fact, did not seem to have any legitimate background and even gave information my family doctor said was grossly incorrect. Trying to get out of the contract was a nightmare as others have explained. The 20 days before your last billing date is totally bogus and having to send in a letter by certified mail when any other gym would just take the info at the desk. Everything about the place is designed to get your money and give you nothing in return. I ended up absolutely hating the place and all the people there."

1541,218070,2009-05-19,,"I have a huge concern regarding one of your employees/manager for LA Fitness in the Van Nuys California location. I joined LA Fitness less than a month ago and most people who join the gym have insecurities. I am in the learning process of how to eat better as well as to exercise consistently. I have asked my friend, Michelle, to join me on occasions to help get me through the work out process because I would prefer to have a friend by my side so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable. It is difficult for me to feel a hundred percent comfortable with doing some of the exercises by myself. She is currently going through training herself for a competition that is coming up so she has a very fit and tone body compared to me in which case I can understand why it would look suspicious. However, we were both approached by David ** on Wednesday, May 6, 2009, and he stated that I was clearly being trained by Michelle. We explained to him that she was not training. She, in fact, is my friend and we were trading off on the balance ball because there was only one ball by the mat. He explained to Michelle that if he sees her training at this location again he would have to take the next step. We continued with our routine that same day and left the facility without realizing that Michelle's record/file was now in jeopardy. At this point, we are both aware of the rules and regulations that LA Fitness abides by and we weren't thinking we were breaking any of the rules because she and I were just gym buddies. We went back together the following week and, once again, we were approached by David and he once again made false allegations and not only did we feel embarrassed, and humiliated but we also felt harassed. Mr. David ** was very unprofessional when cornering the two of us when, in fact, there were multiple twosomes throughout the facility (some were obviously training whereas others were like Michelle and I, and they were just friends working out together). Michelle and I were trading off on the balance ball because the other one was in use and we had no choice but to do 3 set increments while trading off with one another. Once again, it is not difficult to tell the difference in our physique simply for the fact that Michelle does look fit to be a trainer. I can assure you that she does not train me and there is no difference in what the other sets of individuals are doing and what we were doing.Once we pointed out that there were other people doing exactly what we were doing, he chose to ignore our justifications and in a condescending tone, he then revoked Michelle's membership. I am appalled by the ethics this facility conducts. Perhaps the Code of Ethics are not only trained but not exercised as a manager. Michelle and I are very close friends and there are many people who have gym buddies and for David to make assumptions and harass us is completely uncalled for and unprofessional. When Michelle made a phone call to Corporate, she was brushed off again and was told she couldn't return to the Van Nuys facility but they would make the accommodations for her so she can continue having a membership with other facilities. We find this offensive and we feel that we are being treated unfairly."
1542,218069,2009-05-19,,"I received a flyer from LA Fitness in the mail to try their facility for 7 days for free. They had just opened 2 weeks ago, so I was interested. There was no asterisk or catch to it on the coupon. It just said, ""Other memberships may be presented.” So, I went in and the sales person Shaun ** took the coupon, asked me if I was serious about joining. I said, “Yes, I was” because I was interested in joining at a later date. So he then went on to tell me that the pass was for 3 days and that then I would be charged for the first month of membership and last month of membership and wouldn't have to pay registration fee. I told him I wasn't sure about that and that I would think about it. Then he offered me a tour of the gym. I thought, “I'm already in here, might as well.” After the tour he said, “So, do you want to give it a try?” I was thinking, I get to try for 3 days and if I don't cancel, I get charged. So he took my card and the next thing I knew, he's asking me to sign for $79.95. I said, “That is not what we discussed” and told him to cancel it and he said, ""Well, you might as well sign it because it's already gone through.” Without my signature on it yet! He then said, ""Just come try a class and later if you don't like it, I'll cancel it for you,"" telling me I'd get a refund in 3-5 days. I left, pissed and upset because I didn't have that amount in my account. I came back less than 5 min. later telling AnnMarie, the operating manager, to cancel it. She did. The next day, when the overdraft was on my account, my financial advisor as well as a friend of mine (who owns a gym) told me to demand reimbursement for the overdraft fee because it was their fault. I went in to the gym the next day and Dominic ** told me I needed to speak with AnnMarie. I went in the day after that and AnnMarie told me it was Dominic that I was supposed to speak with. She told us that the company never reimburses those kinds of fees and there was nothing she could do at her level. So I called corporate. James **, a customer service member, told me he would not give me the district or regional manager's number and that they would contact me in 24 hrs. The director’s name was Rene **. Sean came in, spoke down to me and tried to make it seem like he did nothing wrong, that I knew I was getting charged, and that he was trying to save money. Yeah. Right. He then tried to dismiss me by saying, ""Fine, I'll give her, her $25 fee out of my own pocket."" But it's not just about the money. They are tricking people into memberships, telling one thing and doing another and he shouldn't have done it to me or be allowed to do that to someone else. So I called the customer service number again, told the woman to have a director call me ASAP. That was at 4 pm central time. Still no word. And they didn't call me after the initial complaint. It's been 4 days. They are not taking me seriously and trying to sweep the matter under the rug."
1543,218068,2009-05-18,,"The customer service is absolutely lousy. They should have actually been called ""customer irritating representatives."" I guess their job is just trying to keep the money you paid in advance and keep charging you for service you have not used. I made a complaint to BBB and will see how it works. If it is not working, I may just file case at the local small claim court. This is how it works if you want them to respond to you fast and nice."
1544,218067,2009-05-15,,"In July, I cancelled my membership at LA Fitness. I went into the center and was told that I would have to write a letter. A letter was written. However, my bank statements continue to show this company is pulling money out of my account. I sent a letter and also went in person; however, they continue to steal money out of my account."
1545,218066,2009-05-13,,"I canceled my membership at LA Fitness and now they keep calling, saying my membership hasn't been canceled. They are saying they are continually charging me every month and I haven't been there in 6 months. I keep receiving harassing phone calls. I keep telling them to cancel my membership and they refuse, and are still charging me. They are going to send this to collections and will keep charging me every month."
1546,218065,2009-05-12,,"I have had several issues over the last month with LA Fitness (Keller, TX) mischarging my account. The most recent event, I was charged twice on the same day for $120 and $10. When I called to discuss this, they claim they do not know why this is on my account. Several weeks have gone by and I have not been provided with a reason or my checking account credited back. This practice of unresponsiveness and fraud charging to my account reflects how LA Fitness is integrated into our communities. It’s about their profit and not so much about a professional service in the community. Check your bank account monthly!"
1547,218064,2009-05-10,,"I work for LA Fitness! This is the most unethical company I have ever been associated with. Rob and now Lee are the managers I have dealt with. All they do is steal from their employees, lie to present clients and mislead and misrepresent any and all aspects of LA Fitness. The company expects sales reps to work for minimum wage, do all prospecting and marketing out of their own pocket while management sits around and steal from them. They lie about everything and upper management doesn't care because it's about new memberships, not about anything else. Bottom line is all financial terms are not true. Never pay anything close to their beginning price and always buy at the end of the month, when they drop their pants! Registration fees are a joke and will be waived in a heartbeat. Never pay them no matter what. Monthly dues should never be more than $34.99 per month for a multi-club membership, period! Never deal with the slim ball managers. They use worse than used car salesmen techniques, ""How can I earn your business?"" Please! They are all liars and thieves. They actually just fired Rob (manager) who claimed to be a missionary for stealing money! Bottom line is, avoid at all cost. If you are in need, just make sure you take it for what it is, a membership-driven ** house, and always buy at the end of the month. Nothing more than a newer Bally's for twice the money."
1548,218063,2009-05-06,,"I cancelled my membership once, back in March 2009, only to be charged the $70.00 in membership fees in April. I disputed this with LA Fitness and my bank. LA Fitness said they never received my letter. So I immediately sent another letter off, overnighted it with a return receipt so that I knew they had gotten it. I received their email saying the account was cancelled and would be officially closed on June 11th, the last thirty days of my contract (I received a free thirty days for a month paid ahead of time). Come today, May 6th, I'm charged yet again $70.00 in membership fees. I called LA Fitness and got a song and dance about how I didn't send it out 20 days in advance, and that they can bill me for May 6th - that the account will officially be closed on June 11th."
1549,218062,2009-05-06,,"On 3/10/09, I paid Crunch Fitness in full for a 14- month contract. On 4/8/09, Crunch closed & transferred my contract to LA Fitness. LA Fitness claims they cannot produce a copy of my contract with them. Since 4/12/09 I have been trying to get anything in writing from them. I have spoken to the manager of my local club Akers Mill II 2995 Cobb Parkway Atlanta, GA 30339 (770) 956-9093, as well as the corporate office in Irvine, CA. I have spoken to Andrea, Virginia, Laura ** and Damon **. They said they have contacted their accounting office and there was no way to get me any paperwork. Plus, the club just sucks. I can't get on machines, never can get free weights, and I have to sit in a classroom 20 min. in advance to get a spot. There are no mats for the hard floor for yoga or pilates. They are just terribly rude people at the front desk. Horrible and mean."
1550,218061,2009-05-06,,"I am asking them to cancel my Gym membership since I am relocating in California. They told me that I could not do that until I resolve my balance with them and it would take 20 days before they could cancel my membership and since it needs 20 days notice to cancel this membership, that would mean I will incur again another month since my dues are billed every 22nd of the month and I mailed that cancellation on the 5th of May. They printed a cancellation form but I was told I still could not cancel my application since I still owe a balance with them. My point is, I paid 1 month in advance so they could use that money for this month so actually I am paid already. And since I am relocating, they should be considerate with my plea since I am moving 400 miles away for a job."
1551,218060,2009-05-04,,"A club member, Brett (I don't know his last name), had been bothering me and harassing me for a while. I tried to ignore him but he continued. I went to the gym at different times but he was always there. Sometimes he sees me in the parking lot as I am going into the gym with my 8-month-old son and he walks me in. He will stop me as I am walking in to the gym to see my baby. He is always asking about my baby. As a parent, this freaks me out a little. He is not a friend at all. I don't even know him except that we go to the same gym. On March 25, 2009, I told one of the female managers, Lori, about him. All I had to say was, ""I have a problem with a gym member,"" and she knew exactly who I was referring to. Lori told me that there have been many complaints by other women there about him bothering them. She, herself, has had many talks with him about his behavior. She had said that if they get one more complaint about Brett, they would revoke his membership. He harassed my friend, Sarah, who is also a member there so much so that the management told him to leave her alone and to not talk to her anymore. She said his response was, ""You need to hear my side of this."" This shows that he doesn't think he is doing anything wrong. On March 26, 2009, the same manager I spoke with said that the problem was taken care of that morning. I wasn't given the details of what was said, only that the issue was dealt with. I was at the gym the next day and he was there. He walked by the treadmill I was on and waved and said, ""Hi!"" I ignored him.Brett sits on the machine next to where I am working out and just stares at me waiting for an opportunity to talk to me. I have to run away to get away from him. Brett, according to the manager, has been given several warnings about his behavior. He obviously does not understand the situation. I am very disappointed at LA Fitness for not having a Zero Tolerance policy for this type of behavior. I am also disappointed that the gym is putting Brett's feelings above the safety of the women members. His actions are harassing and do make me feel very uncomfortable. I hate having to keep an eye out for where he is in the gym so I do not have to have contact with him. What has to happen for the gym and its managers to say, ""Enough is enough!"" I am appalled at the gym and managements lack of respect for its women members."
1552,218059,2009-05-01,,"My reason for contacting you is to alert you to the fact that LA Fitness corporate offices are censoring Fox News on their in-house televisions (most clubs have 10-15 on site). I complained and was contacted by a manager yesterday who told me that two months ago, corporate mandated that the club broadcast one news show only and that the powers that be have dictated it will be CNN. Furthermore, they locked the room at the local facility to prevent employees from manually changing channels to Fox News. They have expressly forbid employees to broadcast anything other than CNN, ESPN, and one local channel with a drama (CSI Miami, in this case). I'm in the process of trying to contact corporate and have not been able to find a live person yet. I want my freedom of choice to watch the news I prefer, as I have been for the past 2 years, at LA Fitness. Is this the tip of the iceberg of Obama censorship? Please pass this on."

I gave him my credit card and told him I had to speak to my wife before I made a decision. He then agreed and said that was fair but a 1/2 hour later I got a call from my bank telling me of a $1000 charge for a 3-yr membership at the facility.

My personal trainer was Eric **. Unfortunately, I did not closely scrutinize the charges to my credit card versus the sessions used. I shattered an ankle on 2/26/06 and called my trainer that same day to inform him that I would not be in for several months, as I was going to have surgery. He told me that he would take care of everything and cancel our planned appointments. I have two jobs and struggled to maintain both of them while wheelchair-bound and recovering, which took many months. In April, I noticed that I was still being charged for personal training sessions and called them. On 5/2/06, I talked to a Ron ** (949) 255-7200 ext. ** and requested a complete listing of all the sessions I had been charged for. I demanded that they quit charging me for personal sessions and refund the charges for unused sessions. It took many letters and many phone calls, but I finally got a list of all the sessions I had been charged for in July 2006. I keep a detailed calendar (to survive 2 jobs, it is a must) and I quickly found that I was charged for many sessions I had not attended or even made appointments for. There is even one charge with a trainer I never even met.They did stop charging me for sessions at that point, the last one (at that time) being for April 15th - while I was still in a wheelchair. I began arguing for a refund but they just stalled, and then sent me a note stating that I had cancelled my membership - which I had not done - just the personal training sessions. I never complained about paying the monthly membership fee during the months I did not use the gym. Their contract says that they cannot cancel the membership, so I pointed that out and told them that if they would reimburse me for the unused sessions I had been fraudulently charged for ($1,716.00) plus the unused months of membership dues ($209.94) for a total of $1,925.94 - that I would gladly leave as they clearly wanted me gone.They told me that they would not reimburse me for the sessions but that I could use them up. Since I needed to work out anyway, I agreed. I started meeting with a personal trainer on 8/22/06 at the Upland location. I used 14 sessions (of the 55 due me) between 8/22/06 and 10/10/06. When I went to the gym on 10/12/06, I was denied access. I was then told that they had only given me 60 days to use all of my unused sessions and the 60 days had passed. I was not quite accurate as I should have had another 10 days even under this bogus scenario. I tried to find someone at LA Fitness who would talk to me and no one would.At this point, I was swamped with work, the holidays were coming, and I just gave up for a while. I spent some time in early 2007 trying to find out what my legal options were, but it seemed the effort was insurmountable. I calculate that they still owe me somewhere between $1,279.20 and $1,489.14 - depending on whether the 6 months of membership dues is included or not. Can you help me?"
1557,218054,2009-04-24,,"LA Fitness La Mirada is a dirty, filthy hole. The managers say if you don't like, call corporate. When I called corporate, they said we will pass it on the district manager but still not changed. They have not cleaned the equipment in over a year. They have a cleaning crew of 1 who hides out and they have a manager that refuses to do anything. LA Fitness, in my opinion, needs to go out of business - the sooner the better. Illness is the consequence of this filth. After 5 years, no more for me. Most of the regulars are gone."
1558,218053,2009-04-17,,"I recently joined the LA Fitness in North Brunswick, NJ and I included my family to my membership. I have met the most unprofessional team manager and fitness trainer. The fitness trainer offended me. At this time, I want to discuss it to my lawyer."
1559,218052,2009-04-10,,"I have requested on several occasions to have my membership cancelled since August of 2008. I keep getting told that I must mail off an official request form to their office in Irvine, California. I mailed this request and personally brought a letter, along with my key tag to the location I joined. The manager I spoke with says they can freeze my account until it is cancelled by their corporate office. I keep getting membership fees deducted from my checking account! I call again and keep getting the same song and dance about waiting for their corporate office to cancel the account."
1560,218051,2009-04-09,,"I went to work out at the LA Fitness facility in Euless, TX. I had been out of town on business. I am a professional musician. This was on 8 April 2009. I went to where I had last left my equipment in the locker room and the lock had been cut and all of my items were gone. I understand the policy of cutting locks and taking out the equipment but I was under the assumption that my personal things would be in a storage for me, or I would have been contacted letting me know my things were there and either come get them - or let them know it was fine to get rid of my property. I was not informed either way, and when I talked to Traci, the manager, she said that one of her employees, Carlos, had cut the lock and removed my stuff and that my things had been placed in a room for me until I got back. I talked to Steve **, Traci's boss, and he apologized and said there was nothing they could do. Bottom line, my things were donated to Goodwill without my permission. I was not contacted and there was nothing to prove to me that my things were actually donated, no record of any donation. I believe someone inside kept it. So, basically, my things were stolen from me. It was a very expensive Harley-Davidson bag leather given to me by a dear friend plus two racquets and racquet balls and gloves, clothes, i.e., my warm-up suit and my business cards and money and jewelry. I am a heart patient and a diabetic, and I am so upset over this. I joined the gym along with my fiance to release stress and help with my health. I am so upset over this. I feel like I have no help or recourse. All I was told by Jessica ** at corporate was ""too bad"" and she was very rude and she hung up on me. What kind of customer service is this? If my payments are late, they certainly will come after me. I would like to be able to continue going without worry over some kind of abuse by managers because I want some explanation or compensation. Wouldn't anybody? I could not and cannot sleep over this."
1561,218050,2009-04-09,,"I visited LA Fitness on 04-07-09 as a former member. I have been a member for two years. I was working out my legs when a personal trainer approached me asking me if I had ever trained with one. I said no but that I was thinking about it. He took me to his desk. He told that it would only cost me $156 for 5 mo. I trusted him and he charged my card. It came to my surprise that when I looked into my bank account, I was short $640! This guy, Mohammad, is a total idiot. He charged my account like 4 times. I mean I don't know, what he was thinking? I was told that I would get my money back, but I don't know. I'm still waiting. It's so sad to see this happened and how people can be so cruel and have no heart. I work hard for my money. Please, people, do not join LA Fitness. They are total crooks!"
1562,218049,2009-04-08,,"I started in November to cancel my ex-wife's membership and schedule my training that I was paying for. My ex sent in 3 cancellations. I sent in one on her and was told training was put in her membership number, not mine. I asked for managers no less than 10 times on 10 different occasions to have it changed and let me know when I could schedule. It never happened. I finally went in after being overbilled several times and the employee started pushing my buttons. I got loud and they called the police on me, and banned me from the club. After paying over $1,300 and no use of the club, I was told no refund. The district manager Jason ** called and said I could use the club - to take a copy of the bank statement to the club, to be faxed to him. It didn't go well. I was very calm, and the supposed manager was verbally abusive to me. I have called the corporate offices 6 times with no return call and one hung up. Jason ** was to call me on Friday, April 3, but still no call. On April 8, I called bank and they reversed charges from the last 30 days. I was told by Jason ** that I will be sued by LA Fitness for breaking the contract when in fact, they broke the contract by not providing services. How can someone on a fixed income go against corporate attorneys of LA Fitness, with all the money they are ripping people off they have."
1563,143591,2009-04-06,,"I joined LA fitness about two years ago (what a pleasure it was to join them). After August 2008, I didn't have the need to use the facilities; therefore, I canceled the membership (late August or early in September). I have not attended LA Fitness since August and I sent a form which I downloaded from the Internet requesting cancellation of the membership. After two months, they continue taking money from my bank account. I called them up and they said they didn't get any cancellation. In November, I sent another cancellation which I picked up from the actual store. By December, I noticed that they continue taking money out of my account. At that moment, I cancelled my credit card in order for LA Fitness to stop taking money from it. Until today, they keep harassing me to pay them the monthly fee. Of course, by now, it is not only one month - it is over $100 due to the late fees. I have contacted LA Fitness by phone and in person at the Tempe facilities. They don't care other than collecting money. At this moment, I am refusing to pay; they already took like three months. I would like for LA Fitness to stop harassing me. Like I have said earlier, it was a pleasure to join them and now, it is the biggest hassle of my life."
1564,218048,2009-04-02,,"My girlfriend and I just recently joined LA Fitness in Stamford, CT. We really don't have a ton of money but decided to join the gym to get in shape for the summer. After about two weeks of not being able to get to the gym at all because of schedule conflicts, I called LA Fitness and asked them to please refund our payment made in cash for the sum of $300. The operations manager told us that we only had three days to cancel the contract and get a refund. When we were debating on signing up with LA Fitness, the sales rep never mentioned the three-day window to us. He just smiled and said, ""If you don't like it, you can just cancel at anytime."" So, we are now at a loss of $300 and have a very bad perception of LA Fitness. I truly feel we were treated unfairly and taken full advantage of. Is there anything you can do for us?"
1565,218047,2009-04-02,,"LA Fitness has been charging my credit card for over a year when I had already told them to cancel the account. Since last year of 2008 in the month of January, I have not used the gym. At that point, I put my account on freeze thinking that my credit card would only be charged an amount of $10, but LA Fitness still kept on charging $45 monthly for over a year. I filled out the paperwork for cancellation in Cerritos, CA where I opened my account although I spoke with a gentleman called John from the LA Fitness in Downey, CA and he didn't care, not one bit about my situation. He was only pressuring me for more money and just kept on charging me. Until this point, I still owe LA Fitness."
1566,218046,2009-04-01,,"My husband and I signed up with a personal trainer (who is great). I started reviewing my training history because the charge to my credit card looked high than it should be for the sessions. They overbilled in February and March for sessions we did not attend or even schedule. We talked to the Training Operations Manager and Gym Operations Manager, and have not gotten the issue resolved. They credited one day, but not the other for reasons we do not know. They say they will contact us, but they never follow through. I called the corporate office today (what a joke) and was told I had to talk to the VP of training, but he had to contact me as they are not supposed to give out his number (I am sure because he would be overwhelmed with complaints). So to summarize, as a customer of LA Fitness, I have gotten the complete runaround by all. Managers have not reached a resolution and have no idea when or if this will get resolved. What has happened to customer service in this country?"
1567,218045,2009-03-18,,"LA Fitness is an unethical company who is out to collect fees and that is it. I went through many hoops trying to cancel the membership. I tried printing out the cancellation form from their website, but the link wasn't working. I called the gym I usually went to and the pri*k says sorry, call corporate. I asked him to fax me the cancellation form and he responds Sorry, we don't do that here"

1569,218043,2009-03-17,,"I recently was offered a 3 day trial pass at La Fitness in Beavercreek, OH, on a walk-in. After this trial period, I was asked if there would be any interest in becoming a member. On 3/11/09, a one year commitment contract was agreed upon and signed with an employee/ general manager, Mathew Banks. A payment was made in the amount of 160.40 cash covering a one year agreement which included the initiation fee, first and last months dues, sales tax and a $6.00 credit towards the second month's charge. On the morning of 3/12/09, I participated in a Spin Class and a one hour training session with a professional trainer employed by this facility. Afterwards, I used the ladies facilities, to change and for restroom use, as I did during the 3 day trial period. On my way exiting the building this day, a staff member verbally stopped me at the front desk, and asked to see my driver's license, claiming that there was a picture of me on their profile, but no verification of a driver's license. I willingly handed it to him while explaining that the physical address had not yet been changed, because it was a recent relocation from Pennsylvania. He noticed the M in the sex status, and threw my license down on the counter towards me, and exclaimed, ""You gotta use the men's room"". I tried to explain that I was in fact a transgender lady, and that though my driver's license list my sex as Male, that my gender is Female, also my social security card was listed as female, and I was in fact living as my preferred gender for quite some time, using ladies facilities every where I go. His response was, ""It doesn't matter, you gotta use the men's restrooms."" Out of disappointment and embarrassment of being outed in front of several of his fellow employees, other members, and not feeling this situation was handled respectfully or professionally, I told him, ""Than I need to cancel my membership and want a full refund."" As I walked over to speak to Mathew, this gentleman followed me while telling me to just leave now and the fee would be credited back to me. I insisted on speaking to Mathew, and explained the situation at hand. He apologized and assured me that a full refund would be given and that he had no clue of my tansgendered status. (He said ""I thought you were a girl"") unfortunately there has not been a refund given (they told me a check would be mailed the next day) After various searches online, I realized that it's not fair to others in the community who are standing up for our right for equality. Original intentions were to simply walk away and search for a gym that would be opened to working together in accommodating a suitable environment, where there could be peace amongst a majority of their members. While doing this, it becomes a forced outing of self-revealance to others who become quite surprised when upon my meeting an introductory is, ""Hi I'm a translady in search of a place where I can peacefully become a member of a facility without causing a disturbance with staff or other members."" This has rarely ever been an issue in my life until recently, as I have repeatedly worked out at many facilities, in every major city, up and down the east coast, including Hollywood, CA. It would be a true blessing to network with the other individuals that are going through this, so that as a team we could combine our learnings, and be a part of educating societies lack of understanding, while fighting for the rights of those who will be following along the paths we work hard to clear. Many thanks are given from many who may, or not, currently be aware how helpful and encouraging exposure of truth can be. "
1570,218042,2009-03-16,,"My complaint is trivial compared to those below and yet somehow just as frustrating. Thank goodness the staff has always been courteous because it is the only saving grace of this extremely poorly organized business. Simply put, I signed up for three training sessions. The first day I arrived for an initial interview, so to speak, there was a schedule conflict so I went again. The second time I arrived the trainer only had time to take measurements, but I did ask for an exercise schedule. The day I arrived for my first training (at $50.00 for half an hour by the way-not to mention the over $200 fee just for the privledge)I had a different trainer who did not agree with the first trainer's outline of exercises so the half our was spent going rapidly through the exercises he would recommend (i.e. not what I would term 'training') I asked, therefore, for a new exercise schedule (which to me was the most important part of the deal)which I did finally get. In any case, I found I was billed for that training appointment even though the initial payment of the fee had included the first training appointment. Fortunately, a few days later that had been corrected without my having had to mention it. Therefore, imagine my surprise when I was told that I could not be re-imbursed (except by 'corporate') for an appointment that had never taken place. In fact, what I was told was that regardless of when I did the training, I would be billed once a month (for the 3 sessions). I argued that I didn't feel that it was ethical to bill me for a service I had yet to receive, expecially as that was not my understanding as to how the billing would proceed(nor my husband's who was with me at the time). The person I spoke to said that the person in charge of billing would get back to me. "

About 2 weeks ago a personal trainer approached my son about signing up for some sessions. My son has no job and as I stated I am paying for the membership. My son was approached by the employee some days later and the next thing I know I am shy $239 from my checking account. And my son was stuck in a 1 yr. contract for a personal trainer that was to cost us some $1600. I have worked in retail close to 20 yrs. and never have we hit someones card without at least calling the individual for permission. The customer service I have worked we went through the proper channels before taking money from someones account unbeknownst to the person whose account we were hitting. Like how about a phone call? It is terrible customer service and wrong and I feel totally unprofessional. My husband went to talk to the employee in question and was basically told sorry for your luck you're screwed. It was my child yes but NOT his money, the account is in my name. Its just good business to get approval from the person whose money you are taking. "

Well I sent in the cancelation forms (3) to the address they said. They did infact cancel the 2 gym memberships but NOT the kids klub! All three papers went in the same envelope! I did not know till now that we were still being charged for 2 kids clubs $20 a month.

I called back and she denied hanging up on me, I asked to speak to the manager, she said she was the manager, and hung up on me again! I was contemplating rejoining after my pregnancy but I definitely will not be back. "
1574,218038,2009-03-10,,A few months ago I cancelled my membership with L.A. Fitness. I was told I needed to make my last payment and that the account would be cancelled by the person who called me at that time. Since then I have received numerous phone calls and now emails from them telling me that the account is not cancelled and I have to get a paper with a barcode to mail in as they don't cancel over the phone or internet due to their mis-trust in their employees. I have mailed in the paper they requested and am still getting phone calls and emails. No matter what I do or tell them it doesn't stop. I believe they do this to make it literally impossible for someone to cancel a membership.

On 02/27/09 I contacted the local gym that I attended and requested a letter or some sort of record indicating the dates I was a member. I spoke to the local gym manager John who stated that there ws no way of them printing information. That the only capabilities that he had was to pring a contract for new members. He told me that I had to contact the corporate office. I called the number that he had given me, and spoke to a Bianca who stated that she was a manager. She advised me that she would be bable to type up a letter indicating that I was a member to the gym during the periods I was a current paying client. She took my fax number and stated she would call me back. I waited 24 hours. I did not receive nothing. I had my husband call requesting the same, we adivsed them of my conversations with the staff members that I had dealt with. This was also a manager, he as well ended up stating that he would help me, took my information and fax number. He told me it would take an hour, to no avail. I never received anything. I called back the corporate office on the following day and spoke to a Vivian I requested that I speak to a manager she stated that she was one. While she was looking up my information I heard music playing in the background. I asked her are you in a gym, or are you in an office. She then stated that she was in a gym, and the was no corporate office persay, that the corporate number that I call forwards the callers to gyms thought the united states. I asked if I could speak to someone above her, and she stated there was not. At this time I was very frustrated, I then went on to tell her that I needed documentation for a surgery that I was attempting to have, that required that I show proof that I had attempted to loose weight on my own. She advised me that I was still in the system in their profile, however that have no capabilities to print any documentaion other then cancellation receipts and new contracts. "
1576,218036,2009-03-03,,"I have recently joined this gym and have been made aware of a longterm, high incedence of thefts occurring both inside the lockerrooms as well as in the parking lot. As well as the corporate apathy to this problem. It is not they who are being stolen from. I have also spoken to the local police, who happened to be taking a report for a locker theft, and was informed that this was a constant occurence, and in his opinion I should go elsewhere. I then contacted the operations manager who explained to me that he did not believe that these thefts were occurring, and that people should know better than to bring valuables to this club. I explained that I had actual reports from the police (6) THEFTS from vehicles and (7) THEFTS from lockers reported in FEBRUARY 2009 ALONE. NEARLY A THEFT EVERY OTHER DAY. Did he believe all these were false? How many additional incidents were not reported to police? He was indifferent to say the least. Explained that they were looking into what could be done to combat thefts that he didn't believe were happening. I know BS when I hear it. DEMAND THAT THEY PROVIDE SECURITY AS NEEDED. IT IS THEIR DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE SECURE LOCATION. "
1577,218035,2009-02-19,,"I want everyone to know just how poorly LA Fitness runs their business. Last March, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. I underwent two major surgeries to have cancer removed from my body. After my second surgery, which was to remove lymph nodes from my abdomen and was highly intrusive, my stitches came open. I've had to pack the wounds all the way up to this point. Well, I never put a hold on my membership at LA Fitness because I wasn't sure how long it would be before I healed. I had no idea it would be nearly a year. Well, finally I decided that I didn't want this membership any longer, and I went in to cancel. There was a balance from the current month because I had switched banks. I thought of getting that fee waived so I could cancel and there would be no problem given the circumstances, especially after the fact that I have given them free money over the course of the last year. Well, at the LA Mirada gym, I was told that they couldn't do anything and that I had to call corporate. That evening, I got a call from one of their billing people. I told the guy my situation, and these are the words that came out of his mouth: “Well, I understand that you probably had cancer, but the way I see it, you're still gonna have to pay this $35.” I was disgusted by the guy. The next day, I called corporate and figured I would surely find someone there who would help. I essentially spoke to debt collectors, who were hell bent on collecting $35 from me. I spoke to one guy who told me that he would waive the current month’s fee, but since they wouldn't receive the cancellation form 20 days before March that I would still be billed for March. I wasn't satisfied, obviously. All the guy told me I could do was to send in a cancellation form with a letter to try to get them to drop the whole thing.I hate to see companies like these continue to succeed. Everything about this corporation is set up to take advantage of people. It's almost like a legal scam. Their policies and practices are all needless, like the 20-day notice of cancellation thing. In this day and age, it's as simple as a click of a button. This is set in place to surprise people, and to get them for one more monthly dues before they can quit. Please, please, please continue to speak out against LA Fitness. Their practices are unethical, and they should not be allowed to continue to take advantage of people, and scam them out of their hard earned money."
1578,218034,2009-02-15,,"For the last 3 weeks, I and many other people complained about the steam room not working and the whirlpool, and we were told they were waiting for parts. Thursday, 2/12, I was told it would be fixed by Friday. I went in there today, Saturday - steam room still broken. I asked the girl and one of the managers when will it be fixed. He said late this week, hopefully he said. I told him what the other guy said. He just shrugged his shoulders and him and the girl mumbled something. Then I was confronted by another member complaining about there are no pegs for the equipment. So we were standing right by a training signing someone else up, and I asked him about the steam room again. The guy who was signing up asked me about the equipment there, and I said they don’t follow up with it. Then the salesperson started to tell me he is going to cancel my membership for that, give him my name, and leave if I am not happy - telling me to get out and being so ignorant that I said we can go outside because he was just belittling me in front of the other people. But nothing happened. So I had to go in the sauna which is packed now, and everyone is complaining about the steam room and the whirlpool not working. While I am in there, the salesman and the manager are looking for me. So after I am done and ready to leave, I stopped by the salesman and he said that they were looking for me for me to sit down so he can cancel my membership, just give him my name. Then I flipped out again. Then the girl at the front desk started to yell at me to leave. She started calling me immature and to leave and go someplace else to grow up because I am an idiot. Still, all this going on - still no manager. I wind up leaving. I looked at my rear window, there is the salesman, the manager and someone else standing there writing my license plate down."
1579,218033,2009-02-12,,"I had a personal trainer set up at the LA Fitness in NJ. I wished to cancel it, and the operations manager at that location advised me (with a written letter) that stated that if a form is mailed 20 days prior to my billing date, then I will not be billed. I sent it out 20 days prior through certified mail. I recently found out they took $320.00 out of my account on my billing day without any notice to me. I was not aware of this because I did what I was supposed to do and sent out the proper documents. I got hit with over $100.00 in fees, as well as the $320.00 that was taken out. I contacted the company, but no one had an explanation as to why this happened. Now, at the time the money was taken out of my account, I had a vacation scheduled three days later and was dependent on this money. I have a deployment to Iraq in one month, and this was the last vacation I was able to take with my fiancee. Edwin ** (a member service manager) refused to issue an immediate refund and stated it would take at least seven days to process it. After remaining on the phone for over 25 minutes, he then hung up on me. My bank required a written request as to why this occurred and that the funds were reversed, but LA Fitness refused to provide that. Because of this, my vacation (the last one I will be taking prior to my deployment in Iraq) has to be put on hold. I had overdraft fees and was advised by my bank to close out the account so it didn't happen again.After calling back several times, I got told several different stories from numerous people, but nobody knew what was going on. I was inconvenienced and upset about the treatment of these people. I also went to my bank when I found out about this, and requested a letter in writing from LA Fitness that this charge would be reversed and not taken out of my account. I received it signed and dated. The funds were taken out two days later. The transaction is currently ""in transit"", and the money won't be here until late next week. I feel that there was a fraudulent withdrawal on my account, being that I have two forms in writing that this would not occur. I had to cancel my last vacation prior to Iraq and lost several days, as well as a lot of money, trying to figure this out. I would like some sort of compensation.I lost several days going back and forth to my local LA Fitness location (I was told I had to do this by ""corporate""). I drove several times to my bank, sometimes spending over an-hour-and-a-half each time there. I spent countless hours (documentation can be provided) on my cell phone, causing my minutes to decline. I got hit with over-the-limit fees from other transactions that came out. I got a bounced check and returned check fee. I had to cancel my ATM card and get issued a new one. That, then, required me to contact all my bills linked to this card and freeze everything.My vacation, which cost well over $2,400.00, had to be cancelled because I was dependent on this money, as it was the last payment required to pay for the vacation, and I did not receive a paycheck until two weeks later. This is the last vacation I was able to go on prior to my deployment to Iraq. Due to this, my fiance was extremely upset and was hurt because it meant a lot to her as well as myself. I want compensation for all the losses I have faced during this time."
1580,218032,2009-02-12,,"I signed a contract with LA Fitness, not knowing that it was a yearlong term. I was told that it was only a month-to-month contract and I could terminate at anytime without being charged any additional fees. How wrong I was! The contract could only be terminated within three days of signing. The only way out was a buy-out, which means paying half of what I would have been paying for the full year. Man, what a racket! I never used the training sessions! I was only with the program for one month, and you would think that they would offer some help? No! ""Sorry, you signed a full-year contract"" was the only thing I heard! Oh, and ""If you decide not to pay, we'll send the contract to collections and they take care of it!"" Whatever you do, DON'T trust the kids having you sign on the dotted line! I made a $400 mistake, one I wish someone else doesn't have to go through."
1581,218031,2009-02-10,,"My boyfriend and I signed up as a couple (so they knew we're gay) and everything went okay. Two weeks into the membership, my boyfriend, Sam **, and I were getting out of the shower when two trainers walking past us made harsh remarks which I will not repeat. I went to the manager and explained what happened and pointed out the employees and he smirked and said, ""Maybe they were kidding"". I can't believe this guy is a manager and should not even work in any public service job! I tried reaching corporate but no luck getting a person. Stay away from LA Fitness and I may not get my money back but will tell everyone I meet about our experience! "
1582,218030,2009-02-10,,"Wet area in club is constantly broken down for weeks at a time. The pool is too cold to swim in. The jacuzzi is regularly out of service and the steam room door seems to be a problem in that it is not closing properly, so the steam room ends up being out of order. As a member for six years, the only thing consistent is that you can guarantee the above problems will occur. I feel sorry at this stage for the staff at Armagh LA Fitness as they are constantly apologizing for these problems that according to them are beyond their control. As a company, you are not fulfilling your end of the contract in providing ALL services that I am PAYING for. I want return correspondence informing me: 1. WHAT, as a company, are you going to do about said problems; 2. WHEN it is going to happen; and 3. HOW am I going to be compensated for this continual failure of the services that I am paying for? I await your speedy reply."
1583,218029,2009-02-07,,"We came back to the club after having left for customer service and financial issues with LA Fitness, only to repeat our misfortunes with them. I reactivated my membership online and changed my own billing. My husband's account wouldn't work for us, so we had to go into the club to take care of it. Big mistake on our part. We were assured that everything was taken care of by Barry - the club's Operation Manager. He lied. He never changed my husband's billing as we requested. Thus, our previous bank - who was in the process of closing and moving away from - was charged for membership fees, not once or twice but 4 times. In fact, LA Fitness would still be charging us if we had not given then a CC at the front desk and stood there while they corrected it. Still, we held out hope and Barry told us not to worry. Well, we got NSF fees as result of their error. My husband called their corporate office and ended up having an argument with the Customer Service Rep about whose fault this was. I was tired of it and went to speak with Barry myself, that is after he did not return the message that I left for him a week prior to this time. Regardless, I spoke with him and he SIGNED a statement saying that the accounts should have been switched and that it was their error. The bank, unfortunately, did not accept this so I called corporate office. Initially, I was connected to Josh who hung up on me. Then I was connected to Laura who made me feel like I was talking to a wall because she never listened!After a month of this, I had had enough and did a conference call with my bank and LA Fitness. Still, LA Fitness argued that they were never paid - even though the bank manager was telling them that payment to a merchant is not required to give a customer NSF charges. And they continually refused to accept responsibility. Laura said, and I quote, “LA Fitness is not confirming fault, but as a courtesy, we will refund one month's membership fees to cover one NSF fee.” Again though, they erroneously charged me 4 times which resulted in 4 NSF fees of over $120 but as a courtesy, they are giving me $33. Seriously!?!? I put a call into Mr. **, Laura's manager. If he does not resolve this issue, we will be forced to take legal action. We are out of pocket for $140 worth of NSF fees for an admitted LA Fitness error. This does not include time and aggravation."
1584,218028,2009-02-05,,"With LA Fitness, I've seen this story over and over. So, I'll be brief and to the point: Tried to cancel my membership because I had been laid-off and could not afford it. Per LA Fitness procedures, I printed off a cancellation notice and mailed it to them. I was told that no matter what I do, I would still be charged for the next month (due to their required 20-day cancellation notice). However, two months later, I was charged again, after the account should have been canceled. Upon calling both my former local LA Fitness gym, I was told the cancellation must not have been received and I should have mailed it through USPS-certified mail (this screams to me that they tear up any cancellation notices that are not sent certified). After calling the corporate number from their website and speaking with a ""Member Service Manager"", I was told they cannot cancel my account unless I repeat exactly what I did two months prior, but this time send the cancellation notice through certified mail.After a LONG time explaining to the rep that this was not an option, she said she COULD cancel my membership but only if I paid for the additional month I was charged, despite my request to cancel my membership two months earlier. I resisted this effort for LA Fitness to get even more money from me for a month I was not even aware I would be charged for. I suggested to the customer service rep that I view my only options as small claims court and/or looking into a class action lawsuit. At that point, the customer service rep said that now she CAN cancel my account and (supposedly) did so over the phone. Now, I'll just have to wait until next month to see if it was actually canceled.In addition, I still have to fight LA Fitness for the fees of an additional month which I did not agree to pay... small claims? Assuming my account was truly canceled and no further monthly fees will be added in the future: ~$80 (one month unauthorized fees for myself and my wife). If I was lied to and my account has not been canceled: ~$80 is not resolved."
1585,218027,2009-02-01,,"Update on my complaint filed on 01/21/09 against LA Fitness Sports Clubs. I met with Jay, the General Manager of Personal Training at the Sterling, Virginia LA Fitness Club on Thursday, January 22nd regarding my complaints. I had not spoken to Jay previously. I had only corresponded with the main office in Irvine, California. Jay listened to my problem and offered several options to include trying to reduce our monthly commitment or putting a temporary freeze on our account. Whatever I decided, Jay stated that he would have to run any decision through his regional manager first. After some discussions, I thanked Jay for not only taking time to hear me out, but also taking the initiative to help resolve my financial situation. Jay called me back on January 26th and informed me that his regional manager was willing to put a four month freeze on my personal training fitness program to ease my financial problem. I greatly appreciate the time and effort Jay took in, seeing this issue through to a satisfactory resolution on my part. I want to point out that Jay made the move to resolve this issue before he was aware of my BBB complaint. I want to emphasize that my complaint has always been against the LA Fitness Sports Clubs main office in Irvine, California and not, repeat, not against the Sterling Club."
1586,218026,2009-01-23,,"The operations manager for the Bonita Springs branch seems to have no brains. First, I requested her to postpone the downpayment for one month. She promised she did but sure enough, the charge was not postponed. To my surprise, whatever she did added an unauthorized and illegal charge of $44.18, for which LA Fitness started calling me and harassing me to pay for an illegal charge. So far, Natalie refused to correct her mistake. Searching for LA issues on Google, I understand why. They are crooks! Simple as that! I do not mind to curse whoever does not refund my money. Having fun with that... If they do not refund my money in 59 days, I will dispute in my credit card."
1587,218025,2009-01-21,,"I submitted certified letters dated November 20, stating that due to unforeseen financial reasons, we had to cancel our monthly personal fitness training program. LA Fitness replied via email dated November 25, which stated ""receipt for end of term cancel membership?"" On December 18th, LA Fitness charged our credit card again for the cancelled training program. I submitted another certified letter on December 20, 2008, again stating that we had to cancel our monthly training program and asked them to debit my credit card. I also filed a complaint with Capital One. Once again, LA Fitness charged my credit card on January 20th. I filed another complaint with Capital One and mailed a third letter. This one via registered mail to LA Fitness to debit my account for the December and January charges. Per the LA Fitness contract, client may request LA Fitness to terminate this agreement at any time by giving LA Fitness 30-days written notice of cancellation to be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested? I have honored my contract by sending them three registered letters requesting that they cancel my personal training program."

I went personally to the club and asked the reception to discontinue our membership. The African American gentleman sitting at the reception told me that he discontinued our membership. I cancelled the direct payment from CC. Later on in January, I get a call from LA Fitness that my account was past due. It is at this time I was informed that I need to mail them a form. They kept charging me. The manager at the club is not helpful to resolve the problem and nobody at LA Fitness takes responsibility for wrong communication by one of their own employees and they still keep billing."
1589,218023,2009-01-19,,"Please be advised that I spoke to a customer service representative today to clarify the membership cancellation that should have taken place in December 2008. I had gone to our local gym located on Route 110 in Melville, NY to cancel two memberships, one for my son, which I had not authorized to be charged to my account as of September 2008 and the other cancellation was for my daughter effective 12/1/08. I was informed I needed to fill out a form to cancel the membership and mail it in before December 5, 2008 which I did. Upon reviewing my statements, I noticed the charges were still being posted to my account; when I called I was informed that you had not received a cancellation request. When I tried to explain to your rep that a request was mailed in, they insisted that it was not received. When I requested reimbursement for the charge, they would not oblige, instead instructing me again to mail in the cancellation request; they would not allow me to cancel in person at the gym or online or on the phone.I cannot believe how difficult it is to cancel a membership, when all it took was a credit card to sign up at the local office. As for my son's membership, this was a gift of two years ago. Several months ago, I cancelled the membership. In September of 2008, he reactivated the membership, and without my authorization, my credit card was once again being charged.I am disputing your charges for December 2008 and January 2009; I expect to be reimbursed 100% for these unlawful charges to my account. My two contracts with you ended the day I cancelled my son's membership in 2007 and when I cancelled my daughter's on December 1, 2008. Once again, you have no authorization to charge my account on behalf of Gabriel's membership because I cancelled that membership early in 2008. And authorization for my daughter was terminated on 12/1/08. It should have sufficed that I went to the local office in Melville to cancel the membership."
1590,218022,2009-01-06,,"I requested to have my account frozen in September due to illness. This is perfectly part of the plan. They have refused to do this and keep charging my account. I have spoken to a rep every month and I get nowhere. Today was the last draw and I called again with no satisfaction. Also, they have a very dangerous situation with people who use the pool to work out as I did. Young boys, about 7-9 years old, unsupervised, running all over and jumping in the pool sometimes on top of those in the pool doing laps. It happened to me many times. I complained and they have done nothing about it. Also, I was promised a free training session with my membership. I scheduled the time and on 4 different occasions, nobody showed up. Finally, they have an open spa where men and women can use, with showers, which are mandatory. Seldom are the showers used. The spa is filthy. In fact, the lockers and showers are too."

1592,218020,2009-01-02,,Both the Murrieta and Temecula locations have had significant break-in problems with customer vehicles. The employees tend not to volunteer information or are reluctant to discuss with customers despite the obvious problem. I personally had a break-in at the Murrieta location. The police officer pointed out to my wife that it was probably an inside job since the security cameras were shut off during the hit on my wife's SUV. I now only go to the Temecula location but even there I won't go unless I am in the first parking space next to the front door because the break-ins there were just as bad.
1593,218021,2008-12-30,,"The LA Fitness location in Universal City, CA has poor security for their members parking their cars in the garage. Several incidents have happen in the last few weeks. I spoke with several managers, including David the District Manager after my car window smashed and my address was stolen. All he could say was that he has ask for security and cameras. An assistant manager told me that they have a parking attendant on duty during peek hours. I guess crime takes a break when business is slow. He told me the best he could do was to take an incident report. "
1594,218018,2008-12-21,,"Hi, I have came across this website while trying to find a list of amenities for all LA Fitness locations. I have read several posts about the difficulty in cancelling memberships. I don't about the personal training contracts but cancelling the actual gym membership is fairly easy. You just have to visit the LA fitness website, fill the form out and mail it to them, you will then receive an email confirmation shortly after you send your notice to them. I left LA Fitness about a year ago to try Work Out World, at first when you call LA Fitness to cancel your membership they ask you to come and schedule a training sesion and try to talk to you and persuade you not to leave their gym (but you can't blame them because they are ultimately sales people). However, you can just ignore all that, visit their website, enter your gym member ID number and create your profile, then cancel your membership using the instructions they provide on their website granted that you have a monthly dues membership and not a contract. I enjoyed my experience at LA Fitness much better than I have at Work Out World and just reactivated my membership. I found the light airy environment to be more pleasant than Work Out World's dark basement type environment and also prefer the availability of being able to get spin classes every day of the week at convenient times..and this goes for most of their other classes as well. So for those who may have had one or two bad experiences give it another try. "
1595,218016,2008-12-18,,I have a membership to LA Fitness but because I can no longer get to a La fitness I am paying for a membership i can't use because I don't have transportation so I call in the the office to cancel my membership and they said I had to come in well seen I can't come in I asked if they could mail it to me but they won't and they are still taking money out of my account so I will never recordmend anyone to La Fitness. I was not told all of this when I signed up they told me I could cancel at anytime just give them a call. that was not the truth.
1596,218017,2008-12-16,,I went in with my girlfriend to the LA Fitness. I have a membership but she does not since she was just down here with me for the week while she was on winter break. I had not gone on the website and printed out a free guest pass so I did not know about that. I had seen fliers for for two week trials so I went in with her to get her one so she could work out with me. When we went to the front desk I told the guy that my girlfriend just wanted a tour/ free trial. The guy started entering her information into the computer and then the salesman came over and asked us what we were looking for? I responded that I was already a member however my girlfriend was not and I wanted to sign her up for a two week trial. The salesman responded that they did not do any trials and either me or my girlfriend would have to purchase a one day pass for $20 or a one week pass for $45. I was like I am a member? Why can't I just bring her in at least for the hour with me? He responded that we would either have to purchase the one day pass or the one week pass. We ended up walking out of there and I seriously am considering dropping the membership. In this economy they think they can charge a person $20 just to come in with them? They are nuts! I am telling everyone I know from now on not to join LA Fitness as they obviously cannot accomodate anyone accompanying me for the first time. Thought they would actually want to make a sale or at least try to.
1597,218015,2008-12-15,,"My wife and daughter wanted a membership at LA Fitness. My wife wanted to cancel after the first session and my daughter has never been inside your gym except to cancel. They have been trying to cancel for a year. My checking account has been debited every month still. I stopped in yesterday, Dec 14 2008, to cancel it personally but they couldn't do it there. They can start memberships there but can't stop them. I asked for the managers number who could help me. Edna Rogrigues wouldn't be in until the next morning (Monday) and I was given a wrong number by the receptionist. They didn't know the number of corporate. Edna assured me that it was being taken care of after quite a bit of haggling. I called corporate and spoke to Jason Morris, who claims to be a Member Service Manager. He said that it was taken care of also. But that is what my wife and daughter have been told over the past year and they have still been debiting my checking account. I have had to get on the phone myself and get upset with them. That is interstate fraud in my understanding. I want a rebate for what they have been taking out of my account.

1602,218010,2008-12-01,,"I signed up for a membership at their gym on 10/28/08 and then on 11/7/08 had an assessment with a Personal trainer who is also the General Manager (Carlos Platero) and decided to sign up for some personal training sessions. I was talking to him about what I wanted and we decided that I was going to get 8 personal training sessions and they had a deal going where I would get 24 sessions free. So he told me it would be $320. So I gave him my credit card and he told me to sign on the pen pad. So I signed on the pen pad and finished up the transaction. Then he folded up some papers and handed them to me and said here is your paperwork. About a week later around 11/12/08 I had a representative from their corporate office call me and say I am just verifying that you are paying $320 on the 28th of every month? and I told her no that I wasnt and I only bought 8 sessions not a monthly plan. She then proceeded to tell me that no I signed up for a 12 month contract. When I asked her how I cancel it because I didnt want the contract and it wasnt what I signed up for she said that I couldnt because it had already been past the 4 day period when I could cancel it, but I could pay out of my contract to cancel it. She suggested that I speak to the person who signed me up. Then I called up to the gym and talked to Carlos- the General Manager and person who signed me up. All he told me was that he was sorry I wasnt aware I signed a contract but there wasnt anything he could do for me except to maybe lower my monthly rate to $180. So I got the Vice Presidents number (Larry Lopez). I started calling him on 11/21/08 and he never answered my calls so I left messages for him and told him how important it was that I speak with him. I called him again on 11/24, on 11/26, 11/27 and 11/28 their office was closed but I called again on 12/1 and still never got a response. "
1603,218009,2008-11-19,,"This is quite possibly the worst possible gym I have ever stepped foot into. My wife and I have been looking around the local gyms in the area and decided to give a 7 day-free trial pass a shot. BIG mistake. First of all, this gym is rediculously crowded. When you ride on one of the bikes (after half an hour wait), you feel the rumble of a stampeed of elephants running behind you! There are literally at least 50 people on all the treadmills which is extremely distracting. Every machine you get on there will be someone standing there waiting for you to finish which is beyond annoying and ruins your workout. Secondly, but more importantly, the childcare (if you can call it that) is unacceptable. The babysitters just hang out with members and chat, who don't even belong in the childrens room, let alone touch any kids at all. When we picked up our 2 year old son, his hair was soaked and he had dirt on his face! The workers there were not even watching him as he just sat in the middle of the floor with a dazed look on his face and the MEMBER (hanging out with the employees) asked, Is this yours?. Like he's a toy or a puppy. Who says that? The girls didn't even flintch. They just starred at us like we had two heads. When we asked them what happened, they said we had to refresh him because he was crying!? What does wetting his head and styling a mohawk have anything to do with refreshing his face from crying?? I spoke to one of the males that was there watching him and it turns out he doesn't even work there! He apparently just hangs out there with the girls that work there. Thankfully, our son was ok and not hurt, but we will definitely never join this gym just for that lack of concern for the childrens safety. And to top it all off, my cell phone as stolen and it took me 30 hours or so of calling this moron of a human being to give me back my phone. So, if you want a gym that is overcrowded, where the members steal, and put your children's safety at risk, then this is the gyn for you. If you're like us, then run as fast as you can and find another gym. I could only give 1 star, but I wish I could give it negative 5 stars. This all happened in only the first hour of trying this gym. If this is how they treat people when they are trying to get us to join, i dread how it would be if they got your signature on their contracts."

1605,218007,2008-11-10,,"To cancel your La Fitness Pro Results personal training simply write a letter to the Better Business Bureau, and wait. Having an attorney send a letter to their corporate office also helps. These are almost always guaranteed to work if your problems are legitimately concerning (and referencing) trainer no shows, being switched trainers numerous time, harassment, stolen sessions, or misrepresentation at the point of sale (the time of signing up), such as being told you can cancel your contract at any time with no penalty or not being told effectively and directly that your contract will automatically convert to a month to month program upon completion, both of which I'll discuss next. Very often La Fitness Pro Results sales reps will mislead you by telling you that you may cancel your personal training contract at any time with no penalty, which is completely false, (in some states) such cancellation usually requires a buy-out fee/penalty of 50% of the remaining balance and can total many hundreds of dollars. Some are in excess of a thousand. Also La Fitness Pro Results sales reps will mislead you about your contract automatically renewing. One of their 'gimmicks' in this regard is to use 'fast talk' and refer to this as your ""Rate for Life Guarantee"", when in effect all of their personal training contracts are set to automatically renew after their initial term (month to month). In April 2008 (or approximate to that time) La Fitness mysteriously cancelled numerous contracts (and stopped billing) those which had entered automatic renewal, in which members checking and credit cards accounts were being billed for MANY months after their initial term, some for over a year, with payments ranging $100-$400 monthly. These contracts (payments/drafts) were mysteriously cancelled yet to my knowledge none of the funds were ever returned to the clients. This was done company wide, and was not mentioned to upper management or club management. This was a onetime thing. They did not cancel all auto-new contracts. It appears they only cancelled those who had been in auto renew for quite some time, as they let many in auto-renew at that time continue, and they still continue to automatically renew contracts on a daily basis. It may also be possible they've decided to let all contracts auto-renew, yet set a pre-determined amount of time they would allow such contracts to continue to be billed (for example an additional 12 months), then cancel future drafts at such a pre-set time. It was suggested to the owners of the company and their corporate brass to provide a list of ALL clients not using their personal training. This was suggested as a way of increasing customer service. This was rejected. Why? They feared that if 'non using clients' (but who were still being billed/drafted) were contacted, they would immediately become aware they were still being drafted for a contract they thought was completed and not using, resulting in people contacting their banks in order to stop electronic billing, and this could cost the company millions! As a result, the only list provide to the club is a much shorter (safe) list of members whose accounts were active recently, but who have not used their personal training in the past 30 days. Anyone outside of that time frame is not put on that list due to the reasons I just explained. I've been told directly by the owner and ""La Fitness Top Brass"" their fear is having an attorney/attorney general shut down their ability to auto-renew contracts which would cost the company millions of dollars yearly. Also their clients have had thousands upon thousands of sessions stolen by trainers, resulting in trainers fraudulently getting paid at the loss of sessions to the clients, very often with neither the client nor La Fitness even being made aware, and sessions never being restored. La Fitness is aware of the loopholes which allow their clients sessions to be stolen, but have done little to correct the problem due to cost and inconvenience. Such solutions could include a finger print system, or a signature verification system, or simply locking down accounts which are not being used. Also all La Fitness gym members need to be made aware that their billing information (while safely hidden) has the potential to used by the personal training department to bill ongoing services for personal training without the main members knowledge/authorized signature. This has also happened numerous times, to unwitting spouses and often by underage children, using their parents accounts even with the sales reps knowledge the child is underage and doesnâ€™t have their parents approval. Sales reps have also fraudulently and intentionally charged accounts of members for personal training services without the membersâ€™ knowledge.

Everything went well until my account was compromised because other activities on my account. i had to closed my account. after this happened, I went in and explained this to the LA Fitness Manager, then Mr. Bruce Vackner. He told me at that time to not to worry about it because i was showing any balances shown due. when I received my new banking details ai immediately went to Mr. Bruce Vackner and gave this information to him and the receptionist. I thought everything was ok. The receptionist printed out a statement showing that everything was fine and upto date. I was also told that this was an authoriztion for them to deduct their charges for the service. what really happen is the receptionst did not forward my new information to the properdepartment. Consequently, LA Fitness continued to try and deduct moey from the old account. Also, because of this, the personal trainer fees were accumulating. Each time when I visited the Fitness Center, i would check with the Manager and the Receptionist. Each they would inform me that nothing was due and that I was fine. Because of the ineffeciency of the management,their trainer fees were accumulating. When i went there to pay for the trainer fees, they told me that they could not receive the payment because their statement do not reflect any outstanding fees due. "
1607,218005,2008-09-23,,"Very dishonest business practices, substandard training practices, both companies make it impossible cancel. My doctor strongly advised me to discontinue my training sessions because of my chronic upper respiratory condition and allergic reaction. L A Fitness refused to cancel my subscription. They told me to mail in my tags, the doctor's letter and a letter explaining the cancellation. I mailed in my tags, the doctor's letter, and my explanation letter in June like they said. They refused my cancellation request! They say $480 to Body of Change (personal training company handled through L A Fitness). Why would I pay for June, July and August, when I paid for the first and last month up front, and I cancelled in June. The last month should have already been paid for. They will not close out any of my accounts until they receive updated billing information and/or I pay the fill remaining balance on both accounts. I already paid over the regular monthly amount for the last month ($40). Collections from L A Fitness (Body of Change) has sent me a bill for $71. I refuse to pay any more. I want both the regular account and the personal training account closed. This company is practicing dishonestly and charging for services I cancelled months ago. I was told I'd have the same trainer every time I went for training, that the nutritionalist would always as needed, and there'd be trainers on site at the time of training if my trainer could not make it. I always had someone new, ( I was very disappointed at this) I was waiting over 20 minutes for trainers to be available when I came in on time, and the nutritionalist was never available to me.They refuse to cancel my membership! They keep harassing me with bills. They won't even cancel my regular membership. I even tried to just pay the remaining balance on my regular account even though I haven't been since May! One of them even admitted they they told me the wrong thing. They told me they'd call me later on my cell. I called them back 2 days later and they had no idea what I was talking about. I cancelled my credit card, however I am concerned this will effect my credit report. I have contacted each agency and requested to file any claims they have made as disputed. I was misinformed by both L A Fitness and Body of Change. Instead of rectifying the situation, they pass me off and refuse to cancel my account."
1608,218004,2008-09-14,,"Put membership on 3 -month hold 05/11/2008, was charged for hold. In September 2008, was automatically billed for restart of active membership. Front-desk representative at location gave me number of operations manager and for to send in, but that person was never in. Call on subsequent day yielded individual who told me I should call back the following day, and that that they do not do such refunds. It is merely stalling, and thus represents fraud. I will be going to the attorney general of the sate of Florida, the BBB, and any other authority which takes such complaints. Even if they do eventually cancel the membership I have been/will be billed for at least 2 months of membership."
1609,218003,2008-09-09,,"I am fed up with them at this moment. My husband had lost his job in April 2008. So we went to the LA Fitness where we had joined months earlier so we could cancel our membership. They gave us papers with a bar code on them that we were told to sign and write a letter telling why we were canceling our membership. We came home and did as we were instructed and mailed it in to them the same way we were told to do, reg. old fashioned mail. We also made sure that we were paid up before mailing this in. The next month we still had a payment come out of our account! We went back up to the LA Fitness and my husband used his card to get in so he could make sure he got everything out of his locker. They would not let him past the desk without using his card to get past. This was July 12th 2008, we requested papers again to cancel our membership. We went home and did the whole process again! We mailed them out that next day which was July 13th 2008. They call me AT LEAST 4 times a day trying to get us to pay them for July, Aug., and Sept. We canceled the credit card that they has access to and that is why they are calling the house all day. I just talked to a manager on the phone and explained to her what all has happened and that we did exactly what the contract said to do about canceling. All they can tell me is that I should have mailed it certified and I need to get paid up. They also said that if I pay half of one payment right now they will cancel our membership for good. CATCH: I have to do it today because there are 2 payments pending. I told her that the credit card is no longer active, that we have canceled that credit card when they would not stop taking money out of it and when my husband lost his job. She said I understand but you still have to pay. I don't know what else to do with these people."
1610,218002,2008-09-02,,"On 03/31/08, I signed an agreement with Joe T. for LAFITNESS for personal training. I had said that I do not want to be in any contracts and that's why I'm not interested in Bally's. He said it is NOT a contract but a agreement and that you can cancel it anytime. I spoke with a late 20's white male on 06/25/08 and told him I need to cancel. He asked for my information and typed somethings on the computer and said, it has been cancelled and you won't be billed anymore. I found on 7/28/08 and 8/28/08, I was billed once more. On 9/1/08, I spoke with Tamara and Jimmy from Alsip,IL location, Kellyn from Corporate, and Joe T from the Lansing, IL location and they said it will be cancelled when 1 year is up. They said the only terms to cancel the agreement was 1.) have a note from doctor saying that you can't ever work out in your life 2.) find someone (friend or family) to transfer your contract to 3.) pay 50% of the remaining of your contract. I looked the checklist provided on day 1 and it said i may voluntarily cancel my agreement at anytime during the initial term by providing written notice of cancellation 30 days prior to my next scheduled payment and paying a termination fee equal to 50% of my remaining balance at the time of notice. I'm paying $320/mo so I thought I would only pay $160 for 50%, but they meant 50% of the entire remaining contract. This was not clear and explained correctly to me initially. My father was there at the time of signing and he understood it the same way. They're saying it's not a contract but an agreement. But there are only 3 reasons which you can get out of the agreement which was not clear. I still got billed $640 AFTER I told them that I need to cancel which he agreed to. PLUS I would have to pay additional 50% of my agreement which is $1380."

On 08/18/08 I arrived at the gym to a body pump class at 4:30 P.M.. I went to the restroom at the end of the class when I was approached by an aquaintance whom said to becareful because someones car just got broken into. She said it was a white SUV. I said Hey that could be my car! I ran outside and it was my car with broken windows, my purse, my 4 year old nephews back pack and a jacket. I ran back inside and told the staff, and she said We announced it over the gym. Hello!!! I was in a class where you cant hear because there is no overhead. At this time the gym is full of people. Apparently this happend to someone else that same day, the day before and 4 times the previous month. The gym owner is not doing a single thing for his gym members. He has been told that cameras have to be installed but still nothing. Im cant believe this. I was out 340.00 dollars and the fear of going back to the gym. I am upset to know that so many women go to this gym which does not have any form of security. "
1612,218000,2008-08-05,," Well I have been with LA Fitness since 2003. My husband was terminally sick with cancer since May, 2008 and I called and canceled the 4 accounts I had with LA Fitness in May, 2008 well evidently they did not cancel and I recently got charged $282.00 07/18/2008 out of my bank account which I did not authorize them to take out because my husband had passed away on 07/13/2008. I have spoke to numerous of so called managers and they all said they will take care of the refund but only $46 just got credited to my account on yesterday 08/04/2008. Then said I need to mail in another cancel form 30 days again or I will get billed again. I incurred over $400 nsf combined with all my utilitie bills going back to business. This is unethical pratice and I think something needs to be done about this. I see everyone that has written a complaint pretty much has the same complaint. The damage is my husband just passed I incurred over $400 nsf fees and they still want cancelled till I send in another letter. "
1613,217999,2008-08-03,," First of all, I have a free gym membership at TOms River Fitness and KS Fitness becuase I am a volenteer firefighter in Toms River. The people at La know that i originally joined becuase i like their pool, its cleaner and much nicer than Toms River. Every year though, in the summer, they offer everyeone free of charge, to freeze everyones membership while they redo the pools. THey did it last year and they did it this year also. Its about 6-8 weeks and they let everyone know in advance. I also have a trainer at the gym which i got a good deal and only pay 116 for the trainer a month. This year i opted to freeze my membership and they said all i needed to do was give them my phone number and it would be taken care of. They also said they would make sure the manager of the trainers Anthony would freeze my training membership for that time. Of course, I am not going to just give them my number and take their word for it, so about mid june i went in there when it was time for them to freeze everything and my membership was accidetnally canceled becuase i sent in a letter to their corporate office requesting cancelation of the training membership alone. (these are two separate withdralws that come out of my account about the 15th of every month- 37.44 and 116.00) This accidental cancelation happened in May, and everytime i went into the gym and they scanned my tag, noone caught onto it until i asked them again about the status of the freeze. Well, they took the funds out, unauthorized to do so, in June and in July and now i have so many fees from Commerece bank they opened a new account for me today 8-3-08 and i have to call Allstate, the bank for my car loan, and capital one and explain why these checks bounced. Im lucky if they didnt drop me on my insurance. i will find out monday morning tomorow when customer service is open. exactly 315.00 in fees from Commerce bank from checks returned because La fitness kept attemptimg to take funds out that werent there. Commerce bank wrote a letter to la fitness and i am going there tomrow to hopefully get this settled with the Gerneal or Operations Manager. "
1614,217998,2008-07-05,,"During the course of my membership to LA Fitness, I opened a new bank account and changed banks for a better interest rate. Before I could provide LA Fitness w/ my new bank account information in order to continue the automatic payments they somehow managed to get my bank account information on their own and I was recently charged the membership fee out of my new account. Is that legal? How would they have gotten my bank information? Bank account information should be confidential and protected, not just given out to anyone."
1615,217996,2008-06-27,," My Brother has an account with L.A. Fitness that for the past two months he has been trying to cancel. I once had an account with them before so I recall having to send them a cancellation form. After the cancellation form is received you are then billed for the last month. In my brother's case he called the first time around April 16,2008, the rep told him that the account was cancelled without sending a form or anything. Around May 23 or 25 we called again this time I'm on the phone. Just to confirm, again the rep explains that there is no need to send a form, and that the account is cancelled. Since we saw the last charge or what was supposed to be the last charge, we thought ""Okay it IS closed."" Around early June my brother's bank account had two consecutive charges, and a letter stating that there is a balance that is still owed to L.A. Fitness. I called immediately I spoke to the rep and then transfers me to a manager. When I explain the details to the manager she then says I'm sorry I cannot discuss any issues involving this account. In my opinion that is a poor way to run a business, considering that the previous reps didn't do anything to secure the protection of the account. (Don't follow privacy act) Second I tell her ""You know that's a load of crap, because I just discussed this with several reps and..."" Call Ended. ""The Manager"" hung up on me. My brother was mislead twice, to confirm this the last rep I spoke after being hung up by the manager, by the name of Susan, 6/26/08 at around 7 pm confirmed that in her notes no manager spoke with me, and that they do not cancel accounts over the phone. Here's a funny note and you can add this to your record. This account was frozen for about 2 or more months, yet they still charge the standard fee? When you freeze the account you can only charge $10.00. My brother went ahead and closed his bank account. As a result this was no inconvenience, but be warned that if anyone asks for any feedback ...we will be honest.

1616,217997,2008-06-23,, Eileen is the customer service person for the Co. She was plesant enough to cancel my membership. She went on to say she would send me an Email. I have never gotten this Email. Even after I call to remind her.I have found no one that is happy with their LA Fitness experiance. This is a looser company that should be out of business.
1617,217995,2008-06-18,,"I signed up for a 1 year term on personal training and also three month-to-month accounts for me, my wife, and kids club. These were all setup in June 2007 with monthly auto-bill (the only option they would support). The personal training contract auto-renewed at the end of the 1 year term and so I needed to provide 30 days notice of cancellation. In February 2008, I provided LA Fitness with notice of cancellation for the personal training contract to be effective after the mid-May 2008 billing. At that time, I also notified LA Fitness that I wanted the three month-to-month accounts cancelled in coorindation with the training contract. All of that was accepted at the time in Feburary 2008. Now, over the span of two days, I've received at least five phone calls from LA Fitness representatives asking for payment on these accounts again. I've talked with three different people to get this resolved and all deny they've received any notification. Asside from the personal interruptions during my work day, the direct economic impact is over $400 USD."
1618,217994,2007-12-06,,"I mailed letter to cancel with form provided by local LA Fitness in July 2007; as of December 2007 they were still auto drafting my account for membership fees even after a second request to cancel using same form was mailed certified mail. I kept getting NSF fees, so I went to my bank to review my account and discovered in about September, L A fitness had been stealing from me. The local office was no help; at the time they stated they didn't handle cancellations and were in between management. This was the story at two locations. On December 4, 2007, new management faxed over bank statements, the certified mail receipt, doctor's statement, and I was told I would be refunded for December only. They would not locate the original contract or the certified letter requesting to cancel that stated on the letter this isn't my first request. I have been billed 5 months in gym membership fees of $35.99 each. I haven't used the gym because I thought the membership was canceled. I've had $128 in NSF fees for one month and $198 another. I spent 8 hours while the local Lawrenceville, GA manager sent emails requesting refunds with the NSF fees. I've spent 3 hours on my cell phone's peak time; it is the only phone that I have."

In January 2007 I wanted to cancel my account with la fitness and I couldnt ever get through to them over the phone, so I went down to the fitness center on January 14th 2007 to get the cancellation form and I was told it would be 30 days before the letter would be received / processed and then 30 days after that the account would be closed (60 days) very deceiving and unethical since I was told I could cancel ANYTIME. Also since I have already prepaid for the first and last month when will I get that money back? And why am I paying for 2 extra months for which I am clearly not using? I have addressed all of these issues many times on the phone and in the fitness center but I got nowhere.

Brian told me he would take care of things and see that I get a refund back.. I called to check back with Brian three days later and he's no longer at that location.. I spoke to another female employee there..she told me that Andy took over for Brian..she would definately have Andy call me back within 2 hours.. That phone call never happened..A couple days later a Tiffany called me wanting a payment for January...I went off on her..she put me in touch with a Hanna.. I told Hanna what all was going on.. She was pleasant telling me she's going to do all to help me.. She told me she was deleting my phone number from their record..so nobody would be contacting me for payment..she would get things cancelled..That never happened today I received a phone call from Tiffany again requesting payment...

1621,217991,2006-10-17,,"LA FITNESS cheated the consumer by not disclosing the total monthly membership fees for the gym/fitness center. For months, their were no taxes charged to the account and the monthly membership fee disclosed was $34.89. However, starting this month the fee has been bumped to $39.99. I discovered this fee hike in my monthly credit card statement. Consumers beware of this scam from the employees who do not disclose their full fees during the sign up process.Additional expense of $5.00/month.

The tour was informative and when we sat down to dicuss the price of the membership fee, we decided that we wanted to wait to be able to compare prices with other fitness facilities. When we said that we wanted to wait, Joe became frustrated and rude towards us. He called us names and raised his voice at us. He stood up and was aggressive in his manner. No damage in the sense of physicality or money lost, but we were degraded by this experience. It is humiliating to be treated so poorly by a store manager in front of other members of the facility. "

Yesterday (4/5/05) I went to transfer the membership to my boyfriend and the girl at the front desk in the North Brunswick, NJ gym, told me that they stopped doing transfers last month and that she couldn't help me. I put almost $350 down and I'm looking to leave the gym and without notice, they change their contract. The girl said that there is a clause that states Subject to change which makes this okay, but how can they do that if they never notified me? I was looking to go to another gym because this one is overcrowded beyond belief - they do not limit thier membership. There were also other items promised in the contract (e.g. towel service) that they do not provide. I provided the Corporate Office Adderess because this is a company-wide change in policy. All members should have been notified. If they gave me 2 weeks notice before changing this policy, I would have done it then."
1626,217986,2004-02-16,,"To Everyone Thinking About Joining LA Fitness (Alhambra, California Branch) Just came back from this location after Jason Ayala, Weekend General Manager, refuses to let my guest in for a workout. I was told in numerous occasions that I can bring a guest AT ANYTIME by Victoria. Therefore, I was dumbfounded when Mr. Ayala insists on telling me that I did not read the fine print. Not only was he not apologetic, but he insists to make his point. Can someone remind him that he is working in a service oriented business? It is obvious that his title has gone to his head.As a corporate officer and an experienced negotiator, I found Mr. Ayala to be rude, confrontational and downright nasty. Who ever promoted Mr. Ayala shows very poor judgment. In fact, having someone so inexperienced for this position shows the lack of foresight which truly reflects the company.No one should accept this type of treatment. I am glad that my membership will end soon. You can bet I will take my business elsewhere."
